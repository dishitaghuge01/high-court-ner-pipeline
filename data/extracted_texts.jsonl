Mr. Rajesh Gehani for Petitioner.\nMr. Dilip N. Mandavia for Respondent.\nCORAM : M. S. SONAK, J.\nJudgment reserved on : 25 July 2014\nJudgment pronounced on : 22 August 2014.\nJUDGMENT :-\n1] The employer-Tekchand questions the Labour Court award\ndated 5 August 2006 ('impugned award') which holds that\ntermination of the workman-Bharatlal's service with effect from 7\nOctober 1993 is illegal and directs his reinstatement with full back-\nwages and continuity of service.\n2] Bharatlal claims that he was employed as a Tailor with M/s.\nVikas Garments, M/s. Vikas Fashions and M/s. Prakash Garments,\nproprietary concerns of Tekchand, which were engaged in\n1/19\ndss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708\nmanufacture of readymade garments. On 7 October 1993, when\nBharatlal reported for work, he was physically prevented from even\nentering into the work premises and told by Tekchand that his\nemployment 'stands terminated'. By this date, Bharatlal had\ncompleted over five and half years employment with Tekchand.\nAround the same time, Tekchand, in a similar fashion 'orally\nterminated' services of almost 19 workers, 11 of whom are\nrespondents in the connected writ petitions. Tekchand, on his part,\nhas completely denied ever having employed Bharatlal, or for that\nmatter 11 other workmen in his factory. Tekchand says that there is\nno 'employer-employee relationship' and therefore, he is not at all\nconcerned with the workers in these batch of petitions.\n3] By letter dated 1 November 1993, Bharatlal protested against\nthe treatment meted out to him and demanded reinstatement. As\nthere was no response, by the justification statement dated 8\nNovember 1993, Bharatlal raised an industrial dispute. The\nmachinery of conciliation was set into motion. Tekchand claims to\nhave sent some reply, but participated no further. Upon conciliation\nproceedings ending in failure, the appropriate Government, in\nexercise of powers under Section 10 (1) read with Section 12(5)\nalongwith Section 2(A) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (“said\nAct”) made a reference to the Labour Court, resulting in the\nimpugned award.\n4] Mr. Mahendra Agvekar and Mr. Rajesh Gehani, learned\ncounsels for the employer-Tekchand attacked the impugned award\non the following grounds:\n2/19\ndss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708\n(A) That the Labour Court incorrectly placed the\nburden of proving 'employer-employee relationship'\nupon employer-Tekchand ;\n(B) There is no evidence whatsoever on record to\nestablish that Bharatlal was indeed an employee of\nTekchand. The finding to the contrary, is vitiated by\n'perversity';\n(C) The Labour Court has made reference to\ndocuments/material which were not a part of the record.\nThere is, accordingly, clear non-application of mind\nwhich vitiates the impugned award;\n(D) Without prejudice, there is no material on record\nthat Bharatlal had put in 240 days service in the year\npreceding the alleged date of termination. The burden of\nestablishing this fact was solely upon Bharatlal, who has\nmiserably failed to discharge the same. In absence of\nany proof as to such jurisdictional fact, the Labour Court\nerred in invoking the provisions of Section 25-F of the\nsaid Act.\n5] Mr. Mandavia, learned counsel for the Bharatlal, at the\noutset, submitted that Tekchand has been far from candid with the\nCourt and therefore ought to be dis-entitled to invoke the extra\nordinary and equitable jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of\nthe Constitution of India. In any case, the counsel submitted that the\n3/19\ndss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708\nLabour Court has recorded findings of fact which derive support\nfrom the material on record. There is neither any perversity nor non-\napplication of mind, in the matter of record of such findings of fact.\nAccordingly, the counsel urged, that Tekchand had made out no\ncase to warrant judicial review.\n6] The counsels did make attempt to argue on the aspect of\ncompliance or otherwise of the interim orders made by this Court in\nthese batch of petitions in the context of motion under Section 17B\nof the said Act. The counsels for Tekchand complained that despite\noffer of work, the workmen refused to report for duties. Likewise,\ncounsel for workmen complained that despite the workmen\nreporting for duties, Tekchand offered them no work. These are\nseriously disputed questions of fact. Counsel for the workmen,\nhowever, submitted that the appropriate proceedings have been\ntaken out before a Forum, where such disputed questions could be\neffectively gone into. In view of such position, this Court declines to\ngo into the such issue. However, adjudication upon such issue\nbefore the appropriate Forum, is expressly kept open.\n7] Counsels for Tekchand are right in their contentions that\nburden of proving existence of 'employer-employee relationship'\nwas upon the workman-Bharatlal, who had asserted the same. The\nSupreme Court, whilst approving the decisions of Kerala and\nCalcutta High Court as held:\n“It is a well settled principle of law that the person who\nsets up a plea of existence of relationship of employer\nemployee, the burden would be upon him”.1\n1 Workmen of Nilgiri Coop. Mkt. Soc. Ltd. vs. State of T.N. & ors. - (2004) 3 SCC 514, N.C. John v.\nSecy. Thodupuzha Taluk Shop & Commercial Establishment Workers' Union – 1973 Lab IC 398 (Ker)\nand Swapan Das Gupta v. First Labour Court of W.B. - 1976 Lab IC 202 (Cal)\n4/19\ndss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708\n8] In the same decision, however, the Supreme Court went on to\nobserve that the question of existence of 'employer-employee\nrelationship' is a pure question of fact and ordinarily the High Court\nwhile exercising its power of judicial review, ought not to interfere,\nunless the finding is 'manifestly or obviously erroneous or perverse'.\nTo the same effect is the ruling of the Division Bench of Calcutta\nHigh Court2.\n9] Yet in two other cases3, the Supreme Court whilst reiterating\nthe position regards burden of proof, however, observed that degree\nof proof so required would vary from case to case and it was neither\nfeasible nor advisable to lay down any abstract rule to determine\nthe existence of such relationship. It was essentially a question of\nfact to be determined by having regard to the cumulative effect of\nthe entire material placed before the adjudicatory forum by the\nparties. In the first case, the workman had produced three vouchers\nevidencing payment of certain sums of money by the . The errors\n17/19\ndss j-W2P0-91340:-B08HC-OS:8708\nbroadly relate to the number of years of services put in by each of\nthe workmen or salary which they drew. Such errors are minor and\nirrelevant, if the totality of the context is addressed. The errors are\ncertainly not such as would go to the root of jurisdiction or otherwise\nmake any dent in the case of the workmen. The plea for remand\nbased upon such errors, also does not appeal to this Court,\nparticularly at this length of time. The conduct of the petitioner is\nalso not such, as would really entitle the petitioner to secure the\nassistance of the Court, particularly in the exercise of extra ordinary\nand equitable jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of\nIndia.\n31] In the result, this Court sees no reason to interfere with the\nimpugned award. Rule is, accordingly, discharged. In the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, the petitioner shall pay costs of\nRs.5,000/- to the respondent-workman. In case any amounts have\nbeen deposited by the petitioner under the interim orders made by\nthis Court, the Registry is directed to pay the same to the\nrespondent – workman within a period of four weeks from today.\n(M. S. SONAK, J.)\n32] At this stage, Mr. Agvekar learned counsel for the petitioner,\nseeks stay on the implementation of the impugned award for a\nperiod of eight weeks, as the petitioner desirous to seek recourse\nagainst the judgment and order, just pronounced in accordance with\nlaw. Mr. Dilip Mandavia, learned counsel for the respondent\nsubmits that the workmen have been deprived benefits of the\nimpugned award in their favour from the year 2008 and therefore,\nrestraint of four weeks would suffice.\n18/19\ndss j-W2P0-91340:-B08HC-OS:8708\n33] Taking into consideration the circumstance that there is\ninterim relief operating in favour of the petitioner right from the year\n2008, it is only proper that such interim relief continues for a period\nof eight weeks from today.

Writ Petition No.767 of 2008 pertains to the\nA.Y. 2003-04 and Writ Petition No.768 of 2008 pertains\n- = : 2 : = -\n2008:BHC-OS:5813-DB\nto the A.Y. 2004-05.\n3. By this petition, the petitioners are\nchallenging the common order dated 27th March, 2008\nwhereby the Commissioner of Income Tax-7, Mumbai has\ndirected the petitioners to pay an amount of Rs.13.50\ncrores by 28th March, 2008 during the pendency of the\nappeals before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal).\n4. Learned senior counsel Shri Dastur pointed\nout the above demand has been made with regard to the\nassessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05 and brought to our\nnotice a letter dated 21/2/2007 whereby the petitioners\nwere directed to deposit a sum of Rs.5 crores on or\nbefore 25th March, 2007 with regard to the aforesaid\nappeals. It appears that the petitioners have already\ndeposited the said sum of Rs.5 crores. Subject to the\nsaid condition, the stay was granted upto 31st\nDecember, 2007. However, the appeals have not been\nfinally heard and disposed of. On 5th December, 2007\nthe petitioners received a letter from Deputy\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Circle 7(1), Mumbai\ndirecting the petitioners to deposit atleast 50% of the\ndemand, otherwise the stay would be vacated. The\npetitioners thereafter made a representation on 11th\nDecember, 2007 against the said order. By his letter\ndated 12th February, 2008 the Tax Recovery Officer,\n- = : 3 : = -\n2008:BHC-OS:5813-DB\nRange 7(1), Mumbai demanded the tax dues. The\npetitioners thereafter again made a representation on\n20th February, 2008 before the Additional Commissioner\nof Income Tax 7(1). Finally, the impugned order dated\n27/3/2008 was passed by the Commissioner of\nIncome-tax-7 directing the petitioners to deposit\nRs.13.50 crores by 28th March, 2008 with regard to the\nappeals pertaining to the assessments years 2003-04 and\n2004-05 It appears that on 29/03/2008 two bank accounts\noperated by the petitioners have been attached.\n5. Having regard to the aforesaid facts and\ncircumstances of the matter, it appears that the\npetitioners were granted stay subject to the deposit of\nRs.5 crores by order dated 21/2/2007 upto 31st\nDecember, 2007 whereby the above appeals were to be\ndisposed of. However, a fresh demand was made on 5th\nDecember, 2007 even when the stay was granted pursuant\nto the order dated 21/2/2007 and continued till 31st\nDecember, 2007. Although the appeal before the\nCommissioner of Income Tax (A) has been heard on\nseveral occasions, the same is not finally disposed\noff. There is no dispute that the petitioners have\nco-operated in the matter. Having regard to the\naforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, we are\ninclined to quash and set aside the order dated 27th\nMarch, 2008 and grant stay of recovery subject to the\n- = : 4 : = -\n2008:BHC-OS:5813-DB\npetitioners depositing an amount of Rs.7 crores on or\nbefore 15th April, 2008. The Commissioner of Income\nTax (A) shall dispose of the appeals as expeditiously\nas possible.\n6. The respondents shall lift the attachment of\nthe two Bank accounts of the petitioners one with City\nBank and other with the Deutsche Bank forthwith. The\npetitioners undertake to deposit the aforesaid amount\nof Rs.7 crores in the government treasury positively on\nor before 15/4/2008. The undertaking is accepted.\n7. It is made clear that if the aforesaid\ndeposit is not made by 15th April, 2008, the accounts\nin the above mentioned banks shall stand attached\nimmediately without further notice to this Court.\n8. In the event the order is adverse to the\npetitioners, the same shall not be operated for period\nof 6 weeks from the date of communication of the said\norder to the petitioners.\n9.

These petitions, filed under Article 226 of the\nConstitution of India, are directed against the order dated\n3rd March, 2010 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,\nMumbai (“Tribunal” for short) dismissing appeal filed by\nthe petitioner together with order dated 25th March, 2010\nwhereby the miscellaneous application filed by the\npetitioner was rejected. The petitioner has prayed for\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n2 wp-1805.10--.sxw\ndirection to the Tribunal to grant fresh hearing on merits.\nSince the issues involved in both the petitions are\ninterlinked, they are being disposed of by this common\njudgment.\nThe Facts :\n3. The factual matrix giving rise to the present\npetitions is as under:\nThe search and seizer action under section 32(1)\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Act” for short) carried out\non the residential premises of one of the partners of the\npetitioner followed by survey action under section 133A of\nthe Act at the business premises resulted in impounding of\nbooks of account under section 131 of the Act. The\npetitioner had filed return of income showing total loss\nof Rs.3,35,997/- for the assessment year 1993-94 enclosed\nwith Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet with necessary\nannexures.\n4. The Assessing Officer assessed the income of the\npetitioner and passed assessment order under section 143(3)\nof the Act making addition of Rs.55,34,140/-. He added\nestimated profit of Rs.16,25,981/- together with loan\ntransactions and interest, details of which are not\nnecessary for the view taken.\n5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of assessment,\nthe petitioner assessee filed appeal before the\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n3 wp-1805.10--.sxw\nCommissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who was pleased to\npassed an ex-parte order dated 18th December, 1996\nconfirming the assessment order.\n6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the assessee\ncarried appeal to the Tribunal on 11th February, 1997.\n7. It appears that during the pendency of the\naforesaid appeal, the petitioner- assessee vide its letter\ndated 17th March, 2004 claims to have informed the new\naddress to the Assistant Registrar of the Tribunal with\nfurther letters dated 7th June, 2007; 20th November, 2008 and\n19th December, 2008 enquiring about status of the appeal.\nAccording to the petitioner- assessee the certified copy of\nthe Tribunal’s order dated 3rd March, 2003 was handed over\nto the petitioner on 9th January, 2009. The order reads as\nunder:\n“The Notice fixing the hearing of the above\nappeals on 26/2/2003, sent by R.P.A.D. at\nthe address indicted by the assessee in\ncolumn No.10 of Form No.36 has not been\nreturned by the postal authorities.\nHowever, at the time of hearing none\nappeared on behalf of the assessee, nor any\nrequest for adjournment was also filed. In\nthese circumstances, following the decision\nof the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the\ncase of Multiplan India (P) Ltd. (38 ITD\n320), we dismiss these appeals as\nunadmitted.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n8. After receipt of the copy of the order, the\npetitioner claims to have written a letter to the registry\nof the Tribunal seeking permission to inspect the documents\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n4 wp-1805.10--.sxw\nso as to enable it to move miscellaneous application for\nrecalling the order dated 3rd March, 2003. Accordingly\ninspection was given to the petitioner. The petitioner-\nassessee during the course of the inspection found that\nR.P.A.D. envelop was returned to the Tribunal with postal\nendorsement “Not found at given address. Returned to\nSender”. After receipt of the aforesaid inspection\npetitioner moved miscellaneous application to the Tribunal\npraying for recalling of the order dated 3rd March, 2003\nfor want of service of notice of hearing resulting in\ndenial of opportunity of hearing. The said application was\nrejected by the Tribunal by an order dated 25th March, 2010.\nThe said orders are subject matter of challenge in this\npetitions.\nSubmissions:\n9. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nsubmits that the change of address was intimated to the\nregistry of the Tribunal vide letter dated 17th March, 2004\nfollowed by series of letters making enquiry about the\nstatus of the appeal. He, thus, submits that it is not a\ncase wherein the Tribunal was not aware of the address of\nthe petitioner-assessee. He, thus, submits that it was\nobligatory on the part of the Tribunal to send the notice\nof hearing to the petitioner on the changed address. The\nphotocopies of the letters carrying initials of the person\nalleged to have received letters in the registry of the\nTribunal are produced on record in support of the\nsubmission made. Learned counsel for the petitioner, thus,\nsubmits that the impugned orders are in breach of\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n5 wp-1805.10--.sxw\nprinciples of natural justice as such liable to be quashed\nand set aside and that the matter needs to be remitted back\nto the Tribunal for consideration afresh.\n10. Per contra, learned counsel for the Revenue\nsought to create some doubt on the letters alleged to have\nbeen written and delivered to the registry of the Tribunal.\nHe submits that from the alleged acknowledgments, which\ndoes not carry full signature of the person receiving\nletters, it is not possible to make statement as to whether\nor not those letters were really received by the Tribunal.\nHe further submits that the record being old, it is not\npossible to confirm the receipt of those letters. He\nfurther submits that it was obligatory on the part of the\npetitioner- assessee to amend the cause title of the appeal\nmemo so as to indicate the change of address. In his\nsubmission, most of the time it happens that the\ndelivered letters do not get tagged to the appeal record.\nHe, thus, submits that the method adopted by the\npetitioner- assessee of writing letters and intimating the\nchange of address is not a procedure recognised by the\nRules governing the appeal procedure. He, thus, submits\nthat the petitions are without any merits and are liable to\nbe dismissed.\nConsideration :\n11. Having heard rival contentions canvassed by the\nadvocates appearing for the parties, without going into the\nissue relating to the correspondence between the\npetitioner- assessee and the Tribunal leading to change of\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n6 wp-1805.10--.sxw\naddress, these petitions can be decided on the admitted\nfacts available on record. The impugned order dated 3rd\nMarch, 2003 specifically mentions that the notice of\nhearing of appeal informing date of hearing as 26th\nFebruary, 2003 was sent to the appellant/petitioner herein\nby R.P.A.D. at the address indicated by the petitioner-\nassessee in column 10 of Form No.36 and had not been\nreturned by the postal authorities. The said statement\nmade in the order impugned is factually wrong and incorrect\nin view of the fact that the notice intimating date of\nhearing sent by R.P.A.D. was, admittedly, returned back to\nthe Tribunal by the postal authorities with postal\nendorsement “Not found at given address. Returned to\nSender”. It is, thus, clear that the notice sent by\nR.P.A.D. was not served. It was returned for want of\ncorrect address. The Tribunal, thus, could not have\ntreated the service by R.P.A.D. as good service. Under\nthese circumstances, the impugned order is unsustainable\nand is liable to be quashed and set aside since it is\nclearly in breach of principles of natural justice. It was\nalso expected on the part of the Tribunal either to issue\nfresh notice or at least to send an additional copy of the\nnotice to the advocate appearing for the assessee. No such\nnotices appear to have been sent. Consequently, the\npetitions deserve to succeed, since the orders are in\nbreach of principles of natural justice.\n12. Having said so, we may place it on record that in\nnumber of cases it has come to our notice that the parties\nare entering into correspondence with the registry of the\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n7 wp-1805.10--.sxw\nTribunal to intimate the change of address without amending\nthe address given in column 10 of Form No.36 or in the\ncause title of the appeal memo. It is also noticed that in\nmost of the cases change of address is not taken on record.\nSometime the letter written by the assessee is not attended\nby the registry of the Tribunal. With the result, the\nassessee does not get notice of hearing. The matter is\nheard behind the back of the assessee or his advocate\nwhich, ultimately, leads to unsustainable order. It\ngenerates litigation either in the same Court by way of\nrectification application or in the higher Court. In order\nto avoid this situation, it is desirable to direct the\nappellant or parties to the appeal to amend cause title of\nthe appeal memo in the event of change of address followed\nby amendment in column 10 of Form No.36; instead of\npermitting the parties to enter into the correspondence\nwith the registry of the Tribunal.\n13. We, in the above premise, request the President\nof the Tribunal either to frame rule or issue practice note\nmaking it clear to all concerned that in the event of\nchange of address there should be amendment to the cause\ntitle of the memo of appeal followed by amendment in column\n10 of Form No.36 with further reiteration that any\ncorrespondence in this behalf shall not be entertained by\nthe Tribunal. If the procedure suggested is adopted, then\nthe parties before the Tribunal would be compelled to amend\ntheir memo of appeal or cross objections as the case may be\nfollowed by amendment in Column No.10 of Form No.36 so that\nit will clearly indicate to the Tribunal the correct\n2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB\n8 wp-1805.10--.sxw\naddress of the appellant so as to enable it to serve the\nnotice of hearing on the assessee at its given address.\nThis will avoid ex-parte hearing and consequent challenge\nto the order of the Tribunal on the ground of breach of\nprinciples of natural justice for want notice. We hope the\nTribunal shall take note of anxiety expressed by this Court\nand inform this Court the compliance of this order.\n14. In the result, impugned orders are quashed and\nset aside. Proceedings are remitted back to the Tribunal\nfor consideration afresh on merits. Petitioner undertakes\nto appear before the Tribunal on 8th November, 2010. Both\npetitions are allowed. Rule in both petitions is made\nabsolute in terms of this order with no order as to costs.\n15. Prothonotary and Senior Master is directed to\nsend copy of this judgment to the President, Income Tax\nAppellate Tribunal. The copy of this judgment should also\nbe forwarded to the President of Central Excise, Customs\nand Service Tax Appellate Tribunal since the problem\nnoticed by this Court is common to both the Tribunals.\n(R.M.SAVANT, J.)

By the above petition, the petitioner who claims to be the\nresident of the area in question wherein slum rehabilitation scheme has\nbeen implemented by the respondent Nos.3 and 4 interalia prays for\nsetting aside, cancellation and for a declaration, as illegal the slum\nrehabilitation scheme on the property bearing CTS No.501-F/1, 501-F/2,\n501-E/1 Part of Village Ghatkopar Kirol, Ghatkopar (W), Mumbai,\nadmeasuring area of 5475.20 sq.mtrs. and for the further relief that the\nrespondent No.1 herein be directed to hand over the recreation ground as\n2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB\nssp 2 WP 2193 of 2010\nper the layout on plot bearing CTS No.501-F/2 admeasuring area of\n1889.90 sq.mtrs. to the federation of the New Maneklal Estate as per the\ncondition of the LOI issued by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority i.e.\nrespondent No.1 herein.\n2. In the context of the reliefs sought in the petition, it would\nbe relevant to note a few facts. By a Notification dated 24-01-1983, an\narea of 4411 sq.mtrs. was made part of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme.\nThereafter, by a Notification which was in the nature of Corrigendum,\ndated 06-02-1997, the said area was increased to 9022.6 sq.mtrs. The\nrespondent No.3 herein, has a Letter of Intent in his favour which has been\ngranted by the SRA for implementation of the said Slum Rehabilitation\nScheme, pursuant to which he has undertaken the implementation of the\nsaid scheme.\n3. We are informed across the Bar that the said Slum\nRehabilitation Scheme in so far as the rehabilitation of the Slum dwellers\nis concerned, has already been completed and the occupation certificate in\nrespect of the building in question has been given partly in the year 2005\nand partly in the year 2008. Slum dwellers numbering 265 have\naccordingly been rehabilitated in the four wings of a cluster building\nwhich has been constructed for their rehabilitation under the said scheme.\n4. As can be seen, what is sought by the petitioner by way of\n2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB\nssp 3 WP 2193 of 2010\nsubstantive prayer clause (b) is concerned, is setting aside the scheme to\nthe extent of 5475.20 sq.mtrs., which prayer in our view, at this point of\ntime, cannot be countenanced, in the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case wherein the scheme has been substantially implemented.\n5. In so far as the prayer relating to the recreation ground is\nconcerned, though it is true that in terms of the original layout, an area\nadmeasuring 1090. 50 sq.mtrs., was earmarked for recreation ground. It\nappears that pursuant to the oral directions issued by our Predecessor\nBench, the respondent No.3 herein has filed an affidavit dated\n23-02-2011, in which at para No.3, it has been stated thus :\n3. With reference to paragraph No.1(a) of the Affidavit in\nRejoinder, I say that the alleged Association referred by the\npetitioner i.e. New Maneklal Residential Welfare\nAssociation is an association of individual persons and not a\nFederation of Societies. I further say that the Memorandum\nof Association attached to the said Affidavit in Rejoinder,\nclearly indicates that the said alleged association does not\nhave any aims or objects of having a Recreation Garden as\nalleged by the petitioner. I say that as regards the\nundertaking is concerned, I say that the said undertaking\nwas given to the Slum Rehabilitation Authorities and I am\nstill abiding by the same. I say that as per the L.O.I. And\nsanction granted by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, I am\nready and willing to hand over the Recreation Ground to\nthe Federation as mentioned in the L.O.I., In view of the\nsame, all allegations and contentions in the paragraph\nunder reply are denied in toto.\n(Emphasis supplied)\n2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB\nssp 4 WP 2193 of 2010\n5. We therefore, accept the said statement of the respondent\nNo.3 as an undertaking to this Court. It is contended by the learned\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner that the segregation of the said area\nof 1095.50 sq.mtrs., of recreation ground into three parts to be provided\nat three different places in the layout and beyond the slum area is not\npermissible. According to the learned counsel, recreation ground which is\nmeant for the slum area has to be provided within the area meant for the\nslum dwellers. It is required to be noted that in respect of the area of\n9022.6 sq.mtrs., which is an area on which the said Slum Rehabilitation\nScheme is being implemented, a composite layout was submitted by the\nrespondent No.3. The said composite layout interaila contains plot meant\nfor rehabilitation, as also plot wherein the buildings comprising of the flats\nfor free sale are situated. In terms of Regulation 11(4) of the\nDevelopment Control Regulation 1991, the amenities which are to be\nprovided in a layout can be shifted, provided it is within the same layout.\nThe present case is not a case where the amenity is totally done away\nwith. However, in terms of the undertaking, as recorded herein above, the\nrespondent No.3 has undertaken to provide for the said amenity to the\nextent of 1095.50 sq.mtrs., may be at three different places and also\noutside the slum area. However, what is to be borne in mind is that the\nrecreation ground is still situated within the same layout, though may be\n2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB\nssp 5 WP 2193 of 2010\noutside the area meant for the slum dwellers. In the context of the\nundertaking which has been given by the respondent No.3 as contained in\nPara No.3 of the said affidavit dated 23-02-2011, in our view, there is no\nneed to issue any directions as prayed for by the petitioner by way of\nprayer clause (c), as we have already accepted the said statement as an\nundertaking to this Court. In view of the said undertaking, no further\ndirections need be issued. The above petition accordingly to stand\ndisposed of.\n( R.M.SAVANT, J. ) ( P.B.MAJMUDAR, J. )"}

Sonak &\nKamal Khata, JJ.\nDATED: 16th August 2024\nPC:-\n1. None for the petitioner.\n2. Ms Tondwalkar appears for the BMC. The petitioner had\nalready instituted an appeal under Section 217 of the Mumbai\nMunicipal Corporation Act, 1888 (“MMC Act”). However, this\npetition was instituted to challenge Section 217(5) of the\nMMC Act as ultra vires of Article 14 and 19(1)(f) of the\nConstitution of India on the ground that this provision\nrequired a pre-deposit of the demanded amount.\n3. On 14 December 2005, the Division Bench of this Court\nmade the following order:-\nPage 1 of 3\n16th August 2024\n914-WP-3117-2005 (F).DOCX\n2024:BHC-OS:12592-DB\n“. Rule. Respondents waive service.\n2. Appeal filed by the petitioner shall not be dismissed\non the ground of non payment of the amounts. The\npetitioner shall, however continue to deposit the amount\nin terms of the ratable value earlier fixed, during the\npendency and final disposal of this petition.\n3. We are informed that Municipal Appeal No. 51/01 is\nto be heard on 16/12/05. The appeal shall be finally\ndecided within three months. Liberty to the Corporation to\napply after the appeal is finally decided.\n4. Office to provide authenticated copy”\n4. Thus, the petitioner’s grievance was substantially\nredressed, and the appeal was directed to be disposed of\nwithin three months. Ms Tondwalkar is unaware of the\nappeal’s fate. The petitioner’s representatives or other\nadvocates are also not present.\n5. In these circumstances, we proceed on the basis that the\nappeal has been disposed of. Deciding the issue of vires or\nconstitutional validity without actual lis is unnecessary. The\nissue of constitutional validity, at least in this petition, is\nrendered only academic.\n6. Besides in Walchandnagar Industries Ltd. Vs The\nMunicipal Corporation City Of Pune & Ors.1, this Court, in the\ncontext of similar provisions contained in Section 406 of the\nMMC Act, has already held that the imposition of pre-\ncondition of deposit of entire disputed tax claimed for the\nentertainment of appeal was not ultra vires of the Constitution\nof India. This Court held that the right to an appeal is neither\n1\n2014 SCC Online BOM 65\nPage 2 of 3\n16th August 2024\n914-WP-3117-2005 (F).DOCX\n2024:BHC-OS:12592-DB\nan absolute right nor an ingredient of the principles of natural\njustice. Therefore, even otherwise, the challenge to the\nprovisions of Section 217(5) of the MMC Act would, in all\nprobabilities, fail. This could also be why the petitioners are\nnot following up on this petition.\n7. This is an old matter that was duly notified on the cause\nlist.\n8. For the above reasons, we dismiss this petition without\nany orders of cost.\n(Kamal Khata, J) (M.S. Sonak, J)\nPage 3 of 3\n16th August 2024"}

Heard learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners and\nthe learned Senior Counsel appearing for MCGM.\n2. By this petition, the Petitioners seek declaration that\naction of Respondent Nos.2 to 4 in evicting the Petitioners from their\npremises without giving notice is illegal, malafide, arbitrary, high handed\nand bad in law. The Petitioners have sought a direction to the\nRespondents to maintain status quo ante by restoring the premises of\nthe Petitioners. A direction is also sought that no further coercive action\nbe taken in respect of the said premises. The Petitioners have further\nsought a direction to initiate enquiry against Respondent Nos. 2 to 4\nand direct them to pay damages to the Petitioner for their eviction and\nillegal demolition of the premises in their possession.\n1 / 4\npatilsr\nW20pl1-264:B34H/1C6-O. S:12798\n3. The Petitioners claim tenancy in a building erected on a\nplot bearing No. 11, Keshavji Naik Road, Mumbai 400009. In support of\ntheir contention, the Petitioners rely upon rent receipts and ration cards,\nphotocopies of which are annexed to the petition. Mr. Jha, learned\nCounsel appearing for the Petitioners submitted that the Petitioners are\nbonafide tenants and the Respondents arbitrarily evicted them and\ndemolished the building standing on the said plot without following the\ndue process of law.\n4. Mr. Sakhare, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\nthe MCGM submitted that original structure on the said plot consisting\nof ground plus two floors, was in dilapidated condition; it collapsed at its\nown prior to 2010. The owner of the said building thereafter without\nobtaining any approval from the MCGM, commenced erection of a\nbuilding on the said plot. Therefore, notices under section 354 of the\nMMC Act were given on 16th September 2015 and 28th October 2015.\nNotice was also given under sections 52 and 43 of MRTP Act, being\nnotice dated 9th October 2015. The matter did not end there. An FIR\ncame to be registered against the owner on 29th January 2016. The\naforesaid notices were issued to the owner as well as to the occupiers\nof the said construction. Thereafter said construction was demolished.\n2 / 4\npatilsr\nW20pl1-264:B34H/1C6-O. S:12798\nSome of the occupants / tenants / owner challenged the said notices by\nfiling suit in the City Civil Court, Bombay. In the said suit, initially ad-\ninterim relief was granted, however, it was not continued by the City\nCivil Court. The said tenants/ occupiers/ owner then approached this\nCourt by filing an Appeal from Order. However, they could not succeed.\nMr. Sakhare submitted that the Corporation demolished the illegal\nstructure thrice and despite this owner / tenants/ occupants continued\nthe construction activity and completed the structure of ground plus 11\nfloors. The Corporation thereafter started demolition of this building on\n8th August 2016 and three floors have already been demolished and all\ninternal walls and slabs of the entire building have been removed.\n5. The Petitioners on the basis of the rent receipt claim that\nthey are in possession of the respective premises since October 2015,\ni.e., since after the issuance of the notice under section 354 of the MMC\nAct. The owner and earlier tenants made several efforts to protect the\nillegal structure, but could not succeed.\n6. We find that receipts annexed to the petition are for the\nperiod January 2016 onwards and the ration-cards on which the\nPetitioners rely upon are issued in the month of July 2016, i.e., after the\nissuance of notice under section 354 of the MMC Act. The record\n3 / 4\npatilsr\nW20pl1-264:B34H/1C6-O. S:12798\ndiscloses that in earlier round litigation, the owner and some of the\ntenants made several attempts to protect the structure by filing various\nproceedings in the Courts, however those efforts were rendered futile\nby the MCGM by pointing out the reals fact situation of the case to the\nCourt.\n7. We find that the Petitioners have approached this Court\nby suppressing earlier proceedings taken out in the City Civil Court and\nthe orders passed therein. In the light of these facts and\ncircumstances, we are of the considered opinion that this is another\nattempt by the owner / landlord to protect the illegal structure. We are\nalso satisfied that the Petitioners have not come to the Court with clean\nhands. This is nothing but the abuse of the process of law. In these\ncircumstances, we dismiss the writ petition with exemplary costs which\nare quantified at Rs.10,000/- payable by each of the Petitioners. The\nPetitioners shall deposit the said costs in this Court within eight weeks\nfrom today. If the cost is not deposited within the stipulated period, the\nsame shall be recovered from the Petitioners as arrears of land\nrevenue.\n[SMT.

VAZIFDAR, J.\nDATED : 4TH MARCH, 2009.\nP.C. :\n1. It is agreed between the counsel that the\norder in Writ Petition No.2768 of 2008 would govern\nthe result in all the Writ Petitions. They are\naccordingly disposed of by this common order.\n2. The impugned order, passed by the 3rd Labour\nCourt in a Reference, directs the Petitioner to\nreinstate Respondent No.1 with full backwages and\ncontinuity of service. The issues before the Labour\nCourt were whether the first Respondent proved that\n: 3 :\n2009:BHC-OS:3442\nthe Petitioner had illegally terminated him from\nservice with effect from 30.4.1999 ; whether the\nfirst Respondent proved that he had continuously\nworked for more than 240 days in a year just prior to\nthe termination and whether the first Respondent is\nentitled to get the relief of reinstatement with full\nback wages and continuity of service with effect from\n2.8.1999. The issues have been answered in the\naffirmative in the first Respondent’s favour.\n3. The Petitioner’s case is that on 24.8.1999,\nit had closed down its business. However, to avoid\ncommercial litigation from the prospective buyers,it\nhad no alternative but to start manufacturing\nactivities on a temporary basis to complete the work\nin hand. It is further contended that on completion\nof such work, it completely closed down the\nmanufacturing activities with effect from 10.7.2000.\nThereafter and to date, it has not restarted the\nmanufacturing activities. Further according to the\nPetitioner, Respondent No.1 had voluntarily left its\nservices in August, 1999 realizing that the Petitioner\ndid not have much work.\n4. The Labour Court has found that the first\nRespondent had established that he worked for 240 days\nwith the Petitioner. This finding is based on the\n: 4 :\n2009:BHC-OS:3442\nevidence including the oral evidence. The findings\nare purely on facts. I am not inclined to interfere\nwith the same. Nor am I inclined to interfere with\nthe finding that the termination was wrongful.\nAdmittedly, there was no show cause notice or any\nother action taken to discontinue the Petitioner’s\nemployment. In fact the question does not arise as\nthe Petitioner’s case is that the first Respondent\nvoluntarily left the employment. The impugned order\nrecords that the Petitioner did not lead any evidence\nto show that the first Respondent tendered his\nresignation after accepting the legal dues on\n3.8.1999. This again is a finding of fact based on an\nappreciation of the evidence and I am not inclined to\ninterfere with the same.\n5. Mr.Talsania however, submitted that in any\nevent,there was no justification for ordering\nreinstatement as the manufacturing activities of the\nPetitioner had completely closed down atleast with\neffect from 10.7.2000. Thereafter there were only two\nemployees. The finding in this regard is essentially\nagain one of fact.\n6. It is true that the issue of closure has been\ndealt with only very briefly in paragraph 32 of the\nimpugned order which reads as under :-\n: 5 :\n2009:BHC-OS:3442\n\"32. Though it is tried to submit by\nfirst party that the manufacturing\nactivities of first party were finally\nclosed with effect from 25.8.1999 but\nthis closure is not established by\nleading sufficient evidence. Moreover\nthe deposition of the witness of the\nfirst party does not inspire any\nconfidence to place reliance on its\nconsidering the admissions given by him\nin the corss-examination. Thus the\nfirst party failed to show that the\nmanufacturing activities are finally\nclosed.\"\n7. Ms.Joshi, submitted that no fault can be\nfound with the impugned order in this regard as no\nissue regarding closure had been raised and the\nPetitioner had not raised any grievance about the fact\nthat no issue had been raised.\n8. I will presume however in favour of the\nPetitioner that no issue having been raised does not\ndisentitle the Petitioner from raising the contention.\nAdmittedly, the pleadings do contain averments\nregarding the closure. The oral evidence also deals\nwith this aspect. The parties were therefore aware\nthat the issue of closure had been raised and was to\nbe dealt with.\n9. While I see the force in Mr.Talsania’s\nsubmission that this aspect has not been dealt with in\ndetail, considering the facts of the present case I am\n: 6 :\n2009:BHC-OS:3442\nnot inclined to interfere with the order.\n10. The learned Member found the evidence of the\nPetitioners not to inspire any confidence. The\nconclusion is not absurd or perverse. In his\ncross-examination, the witness stated that he did not\nknow whether the Petitioner used to export garments as\nper the quota allotted by A.E.P.C. He stated that he\ndid not know the turn-over of the company inter-alia\nin the year 1999-2000. He further submitted that one\nDinesh Vora was looking after the accounts section.\nThe said Dinesh Vora was not examined. He would have\nbeen in a position to state whether or not there were\nany manufacturing activities after July, 2000. The\naccounts would have been relevant in this regard.\nThey were not produced. The relevant witness was\ntherefore not examined.\n11. The Petitioner’s witness admitted in his\ncross-examination which was conducted in the year 2008\nthat the factory licence and the B.M.C. licence\nobtained in the year 1976 had been renewed every year\nto date. In the absence of any evidence to the\ncontrary, there would be a justifiable inference of\nthe manufacturing activities having continued in view\nof the factory licence having been renewed to date.\nIt was not the Petitioner’s case that the factory\n: 7 :\n2009:BHC-OS:3442\nlicence had been renewed only as a matter of course or\nthrough inadvertence. There was no re-examination.\n12. The Petitioner’s witness also admitted that\nthere is a show-room inside the factory and the\ngarments were displayed therein. He further stated\nthat he did not know the reason for displaying the\ngarments in the show-room. He stated that he did not\nknow whether garments were displayed in the show-room\nto attract the customers. This was a relevant\nconsideration. The witness stated that he does not\neven know how many orders he had received from the\ncustomers.\n. The witness not having offered an\nexplanation, it was not open to the Petitioner to\noffer an explanation through his counsel across the\nbar. It was contended that the garments displayed\nwere only in respect of the export business.\n13. Further the Petitioner’s witness stated that\nhe was unaware of the business activities of the\nPetitioner.\n14. What is surprising is that he stated that he\nis unaware of the contents of paragraph 4 of his own\naffidavit. Paragraph 4 of the affidavit contains\n: 8 :\n2009:BHC-OS:3442\nvarious statements regarding the workload from time to\ntime, the financial difficulties faced due to the\nrecession in textile industries and about the alleged\nclosure. Thus he has failed to prove closure even in\nhis examination in chief. Moreover the witness has\nthus not been able to answer any questions in\ncross-examination relevant to the closure.\n15. I am in respectful agreement that this\nevidence cannot inspire any confidence.\n16. There was no re-examination. The best\nevidence was obviously held back. The admissions\nespecially regarding the factory licence have not been\nexplained.\n17. In the circumstances, all the above Writ\nPetitions are dismissed. The impugned order shall\nremain stayed upto 30.4.2009."}

A praecipe is filed by the Advocate\nappearing for respondent Nos.3 to 9 and 11 to 13\nfor speaking to the Minutes of our order passed on\n6th May 2005. The praecipe seeks some corrections\nin the order passed.\n(a). Firstly, it is stated that in the\nappearances, the words \"respondent Nos.11 to 13\"\nremained to be typed. It is wrongly typed as\nunder:-\n\"Mr.Milind Vasudeo with M.G.Gawade for\nrespondents 3 to 9.\"\nIt will, therefore, be corrected and read as\n-2-\nfollows:-\n2005:BHC-OS:7138-DB\n\"Mr.Milind Vasudeo with Mr.M.G.Gawde for\nrespondent Nos.3 to 9 and 11 to 13.\"\n(b). In paragraph 10 on page 8 of the order,\nthere is a sentence which reads as under:-\n\" The Charity Commissioner granted\npermission vide order dated 20th January\n2004. The sanction accorded by the\nCharity Commissioner to raise loan was on\na condition that all trustees shall\nexecute personal guarantees in favour of\nUnion Bank of India. \"\nThis sentence will stand deleted by the following\nsentence:-\n\" This order dated 20th January 2004\naccording sanction by the Charity\nCommissioner, which is modified by the\norder dated 10th March 2004, permits\nrespondent No.8 to execute the Personal\nGuarantee.\"\n(c). In paragraph 11 of the order, there is a\n-3-\nsentence which reads as follows:-\n2005:BHC-OS:7138-DB\n\" Although, the proposal was for some\nreasonable period, the resolution provides\nfor lease of 20 years. \"\nInstead of that sentence, the following sentence\nwill stand substituted:-\n\" The proposal suggested a lease of 20\nyears.\"\n(d). The last but one sentence in paragraph 24\nof the order will stand deleted, which reads as\nfollows:-\n\" Even this suggestion has been accepted.\"\n(e). The last sentence in paragraph 26 reads as\nfollows:-\n\" This we are doing despite consent of\nparties.\"\nMr.Vasudeo, learned Counsel appearing for\nrespondent Nos.3 to 9 and 11 to 13, submitted that\nthis sentence be deleted. It is not possible to\n-4-\naccept this suggestion. The sentence is necessary\n2005:BHC-OS:7138-DB\nto connote what happened exactly in the Court and\nthe fact that the order was being passed in spite\nof consent of the parties for part of the\nmodalities.\n2. The last request of Mr.Vasudeo is to\nextend the period for implementation which was six\nweeks under paragraph 27(G) of the order.\nMr.Sakhare, learned Counsel appearing for the\npetitioners, has thereupon asked a question as to\nwhether the respondents are going to implement the\norder. Mr.Vasudeo has inclined to make any\npositive statement. This being the position, it\nis not possible for us to extend the time.\n3. In view of the above, the praecipe filed\nfor speaking to the Minutes stands disposed of.\n(((HHH...LLL... GGGOOOKKKHHHAAALLLEEE,,, JJJ...)))\n(((SSS...CCC...

The petitioners are the civil works contractors\nand have completed several contracts entrusted to them by\nthe Mumbai Municipal Corporation. According to the\npetitioners, they have submitted their bids for tenders in\n'K'/East ward. However, they were informed that the\nCorporation has given a direction to lock the user ids of\nnumber of contractors. It is the case of the petitioners that\nwhen they made an enquiry with the concerned ward office\nof the Corporation, they were informed that user ids were\nblocked in view of the directions given by the Deputy\nMunicipal Commissioner (Z-1). They were also informed\nthat petitioners were black listed by the Corporation.\nAggrieved by the said action, the petitioners have filed these\nPetitions. The petitioners are seeking an appropriate writ,\norder and direction for setting aside black listing of the\npetitioners under the circulars dated 08/10/2014,\n20/11/2014 and 09/12/2014.\n6/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\n3. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\npetitioners submitted that the said order is expressly bad\nand illegal since neither show cause notice was given or\nenquiry was made nor they were given a personal hearing\nby the Corporation. He submitted that the order of black\nlisting is violative of principles of natural justice and\ntherefore, the same is liable to be quashed and set aside.\nHe submitted that 3 Petitions were filed by 3 contractors\nwho were black listed and their Writ Petitions were allowed\nby the Division Bench of this Court by order dated\n04/03/2015. He invited our attention to the order passed\nby the Division Bench of this Court dated 04/03/2015 in\nWrit Petition (L) No.465 of 2015. He submitted that, in\nfact, these circulars were withdrawn by the Corporation by\nissuing a fresh circular dated 27/03/2015. He submitted\nthat in spite of withdrawal of the said circulars, the\nCorporation was still blocking their user ids. He submitted\nthat the Corporation may be given a direction not to block\n7/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\ntheir user ids and permit them to offer their bids.

Mr.Sakhare, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the respondent submitted that the order dated\n04/03/2015 was passed only qua petitioner in the said\nPetitions. He invited our attention to the order dated\n27/10/2015 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in\nWrit Petition (L) No. 2882 of 2015 in which in paragraph 2\nof the order, the Division Bench of this Court has observed\nthat order of setting aside the black listing was passed qua\npetitioner in the Writ Petition.\n8/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\n5. He submitted that the Corporation was ready to\ngive hearing to the petitioners and the process of giving\nhearing would be completed within a period of 8 weeks.\n6. He submitted that post decisional hearing can be\ngiven in certain cases. He submitted that the Division\nBench of this Court in Writ Petition No. 569 of 2013 in\ncase of Paras V. Mehta Vs. Mumbai Municipal\nCorporation and others decided on 23/08/2013 had,\nalmost in similar circumstances, permitted post decisional\nhearing to be given to the petitioner in the said case. He\nsubmitted that in the said case also, by way of interim\nmeasure, certain contractors were black listed and show\ncause notice was issued to the petitioner in the said case\nand enquiry was held thereafter. He submitted that the\nDivision Bench of this Court had observed that it was open\nfor the Corporation by way of interim measure to suspend\nthe registration of a contractor in public interest and\n9/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nthereafter, hold an enquiry.\n7. He invited our attention to the affidavit-in-reply\nfiled by the respondent. He submitted that so far as circular\ndated 27/03/2015 is concerned, the said circular was\nissued by the City Engineer, Secretary, Registration\nCommittee and the Director, ES & P, Chairman Registration\nCommittee and not by the Municipal Commissioner and an\nenquiry therefore, was being held against those officials\nwho were responsible for issuing the said circular of\nwithdrawing the black listing of contractors.\n8. He submitted that it was noticed by the\nMunicipal Commissioner that number of contractors were,\nwithout completing any work, receiving money which they\nwere not entitled to and there was a large scale fraud\ncommitted by these contractors in connivance with\nmunicipal employees. He submitted that in these\n10/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\ncircumstances, the Municipal Commissioner was\nconstrained to issue these circulars of black listing.

He submitted that the Petitions\nwere filed on 19/10/2015 and the last circular of black\nlisting of contractors was issued on 09/12/2014. He\nsubmitted that almost after 10 months these Petitions were\nfiled and no explanation was given in the Petitions for the\ndelay caused in filing the Petitions. He submitted that\ntherefore, no prejudice would be caused if the petitioners\nare given hearing now. He, therefore, submitted that in\nview of the gross delay caused in filing these Petitions and\non account of the fraudulent activities of the petitioners,\ninterim relief may not be granted in favour of the\npetitioners.\n9. On the other hand, Mr.Marathe, the learned\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted\n11/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nthat judgment in the case of Paras V. Mehta (supra) can be\ndistinguished on facts. He submitted that in the said case,\nshow cause notice was issued and thereafter, the circular\nwas issued, whereas in the present case, admittedly, show\ncause notice was not issued before the impugned circulars\nwere issued by the Corporation. He submitted that there\nwas no delay in filing these Petitions because the petitioners\ncame to know about their black listing only after Writ\nPetitions which were filed by 3 contractors was allowed and\nthereafter they came to know that user ids were blocked by\nthe Corporation. He submitted that it is a settled position\nin law that order of black listing cannot be passed without\ngiving a hearing and without issuing a show cause notice.\n10. After having heard both the Counsels at length,\nwe are of the view that the submission made by the learned\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners cannot be\naccepted. Though it is well settled that, normally, whenever\n12/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nan order of black listing is passed, such an order can only\nbe passed after following the principles of natural justice.\n11. In the present case, however, the impugned\ncirculars were issued on 08/10/2014, 20/11/2014,\n09/12/2014 and the present Petitions have been filed on\n19/10/2015, i.e almost one year after the first circular\ndated 08/10/2014 was issued. In the Petitions, no\nexplanation has been given for the delay and latches caused\nin filing the Petitions or for claiming interim relief. The\nexplanation which is given that the petitioners came to\nknow in the last week of December 2014 cannot be\naccepted. It is submitted by the petitioners that when\nthe petitioners enquired with the concerned ward\nofficer of the Corporation, they came to know that few\nof the black listed contractors received E-mail from the\nCorporation and this was the communication by which the\npetitioners came to know about the impugned circulars. It\n13/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nis not possible to accept the said submission made by the\npetitioners. In paragraph 9 of the Petitions, petitioners\nstated that they came to know for the first time in the last\nweek of December 2014 about the impugned circulars. In\nsubsequent paragraph, the petitioners have stated that\nthereafter they were informed about the impugned circulars\npassed by the Corporation. The fact remains that initial\nknowledge about the impugned circulars became available\nto the petitioners in the last week of December 2014.\nTherefore, there is delay of 10 months in approaching this\nCourt.\n12. From the affidavit-in-reply filed by the\nCorporation, it is evident that number of contractors are\ninvolved in fraudulent practices to cause monetary loss to\nthe Corporation and as a result, the Municipal\nCommissioner has no other option but to issue the\nimpugned circulars. It is true that normally, before issuing\n14/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nan order of black listing, show cause notice is given to the\npetitioner and after giving him a hearing, the impugned\ncircular is issued. In the present case, however, since the\npetitioners have themselves approached this Court almost\nafter one year, this grievance cannot be available to the\npetitioners.\n13. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of\nParas V. Mehta (supra) has observed that by way of interim\nmeasure, order of suspension can be passed. We are of the\nview that the impugned circulars, therefore, will have to be\ntreated as an interim measure for suspending the\nregistration. The Division Bench of this Court in Paras V.\nMehta (supra) has observed in paragraphs 15 & 16 as\nunder:\n“15] There is a well settled distinction between interim\nmeasures,which are made as a holding operation pending\nfull fledged enquiry and final action either by way of\n15/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\ninflicting penalty or orders of blacklisting and\nderegistration. The impugned letter dated 14.2.2013 and\ncircular dated 16.3.2013 indicate that the respondents,\npending final decision on the aspect of blacklisting or\nderegistration, felt it appropriate that no work orders be\nissued to the petitioner or that any further tender bids that\nmay be submitted by the petitioner be not considered in the\ninterregnum. At this stage, there can be no insistence upon\nrigid compliance with principles of natural justice. If serious\nirregularities are suspected, then pending appropriate\nenquiry, it may not be unreasonable to take interim\nmeasures by way of holding operation.\nIn the case of Lewis v. Heffer, 1978 (3) ALL E.R.354, Lord\nDenning drew out the distinction between suspensions\nwhich are inflicted by way of punishment and suspensions,\nwhich are made as holding operation pending enquiry in\nthe following words:\n“ But they do not apply to suspensions which are\nmade, as a holding operation, pending enquiries.\nVery often irregularities are disclosed in a\nGovernment department or in a business house; and\na man may be suspended on full pay pending\nenquiries. Suspicion may rest on him; and so he is\nsuspended until he is cleared of it. No one, so far as I\nknow, has ever questioned such a suspension on the\nground that it could not be done unless he is giving\nnotice of the charge and an opportunity of defending\n16/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nhimself and so forth. The suspension in such a case is\nmerely done by way of good administration. A\nsituation has arisen in which something must be done\nat once. The work of the department or the office is\nbeing affected by rumours and suspicions. The others\nwill not trust the man. In order to get back to proper\nwork, the man is suspended. At that stage the rules\nof natural justice do not apply, see Furnell v.\nWhangarei High Schools Board”.\n16] The aforesaid observations were cited with approval by\nthe Supreme Court in the case of Liberty Oil Mills V/s.\nUnion of India, 1984(3) SCC 465, by observing that\npredecisional natural justice is not usually contemplated\nwhen the decision taken are of an interim nature pending\ninvestigation or inquiry.\n14. In the present case, show cause notice was\nnot issued by the Corporation before issuing the impugned\ncirculars and since the petitioners have themselves\napproached this Court after one year, no prejudice will be\ncaused to them, if the Corporation gives them hearing\nwithin 12 weeks from today.\n17/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\n15. So far as the order of this Court in Writ Petition\n(L) No. 465 of 2015 is concerned, the Division Bench of this\nCourt by order dated 27/10/2015 passed in Writ Petition\n(L) No. 2882 of 2015 has observed that the said order of\nsetting aside black listing would be applicable only qua\npetitioner in the said Petition. In paragraph 2 of the said\norder, the Division Bench has observed as under :\n“The submission of the learned counsel for the\npetitioners is that the orders of black listing as against\nthe petitioners have been set aside by the order dated\n4th March 2015 in the Writ Petition (L) No. 465 of\n2015. We disagree with the said submission. We find\nthat the order of black listing only in so far as the writ\npetitioner in the said writ petition has been set aside.”\n16. We, therefore, keeping larger public interest in\nmind, do not propose to interfere with the impugned\ncirculars which have been issued by the Corporation from\nOctober 2014 to December 2014. We, however, direct the\nCorporation to issue show cause notices to the petitioners\n18/19\n2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB\n906. wp 134.16 & others.doc\nand to give personal hearing to the petitioners. We direct\nthe Corporation to issue show cause notices within 4 weeks\nfrom today. The petitioners may give replies to the said\nshow cause notices within 4 weeks thereafter and the\nCorporation after hearing the petitioners shall decide the\nsaid show cause notices within 4 weeks thereafter. The\nentire process, therefore, to be completed within 12 weeks\nfrom today. It is clarified that the if Corporation accepts\nthe explanation given by any of the petitioners, it may\nrevoke the black list and if the order of black listing is\nconfirmed, the petitioners are at liberty to challenge the\nsaid order. With the aforesaid directions, these Petitions are\ndisposed of.\n(M.S.KARNIK, J.) (V. M. KANADE, J.)\n19/19"}
