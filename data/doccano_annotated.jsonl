The Petitioner is a member of a housing co-operative society known as the “Navbharatiya Bhavan (1) Co-op. Hsg. Soc. VRD 1 of 18 2015:BHC-OS:8115-DB WPL126.15.sxw Ltd. (Respondent No.2). By this Petition, challenge has been laid to the order dated 1st November, 2014 passed by Respondent No.1 granting a No Objection for re-development of the building known as “Nav Bharatiya Bhavan (1) Co-operative Housing Society Ltd” (the “said building”). The said building belongs to Respondent No.2 – Society and is situate on a plot of land admeasuring about 853 sq. yards or thereabouts and bearing Plot No.371 of Suburban Scheme No.I, Chembur, bearing CTS No.1316, 1316\/1 to 4. The Petitioner is also seeking a declaration that the Development Agreement dated 28th October, 2014 entered into between Respondent No.2 – Society and Respondent No.3 – Developer (Heritage Lifestyles & Developers Pvt. Ltd.), is null and void as the same is in violation of the mandatory circular dated 3rd January, 2009 issued under section 79A of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960. 2. The brief undisputed facts giving rise to the present controversy are that the Petitioner is a doctor by profession and runs a clinic from the premises occupied by him in Respondent No.2 – Society. Since Respondent personal requirements of the Petitioner, he would have no problem, either with the Development Agreement dated 28th October, 2014 or the NOC granted by Respondent No.1 dated 1st November, 2014. 16. We, therefore, find that the present Petition is certainly not a bonafide one and ought not to be entertained at the instance of one disgruntled member whose alleged demands are not being satisfied. We cannot permit one member of a society to hold all the others to ransom in such a fashion. We, therefore, have no hesitation in dismissing the Writ Petition. VRD 17 of 18 2015:BHC-OS:8115-DB WPL126.15.sxw 17. The Writ Petition is accordingly dismissed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, we leave the parties to bear their own costs. (B.

Mr. Dilip N. Mandavia for Respondent. CORAM : M. S. SONAK, J. Judgment reserved on : 25 July 2014 Judgment pronounced on : 22 August 2014. JUDGMENT :- 1] The employer-Tekchand questions the Labour Court award dated 5 August 2006 ('impugned award') which holds that termination of the workman-Bharatlal's service with effect from 7 October 1993 is illegal and directs his reinstatement with full back- wages and continuity of service. 2] Bharatlal claims that he was employed as a Tailor with M\/s. Vikas Garments, M\/s. Vikas Fashions and M\/s. Prakash Garments, proprietary concerns of Tekchand, which were engaged in 1\/19 dss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708 manufacture of readymade garments. On 7 October 1993, when Bharatlal reported for work, he was physically prevented from even entering into the work premises and told by Tekchand that his employment 'stands terminated'. By this date, Bharatlal had completed over five and half years employment with Tekchand. Around the same time, Tekchand, in a similar fashion 'orally terminated' services of almost 19 workers, 11 of whom are respondents in the connected writ petitions. Tekchand, on his part, has completely denied ever having employed Bharatlal, or for that matter 11 other workmen in his factory. Tekchand says that there is no 'employer-employee relationship' and therefore, he is not at all concerned with the workers in these batch of petitions. 3] By letter dated 1 November 1993, Bharatlal protested against the treatment meted out to him and demanded reinstatement. As there was no response, by the justification statement dated 8 November 1993, Bharatlal raised an industrial dispute. The machinery of conciliation was set into motion. Tekchand claims to have sent some reply, but participated no further. Upon conciliation proceedings ending in failure, the appropriate Government, in exercise of powers under Section 10 (1) read with Section 12(5) alongwith Section 2(A) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (“said Act”) made a reference to the Labour Court, resulting in the impugned award. 4] Mr. Mahendra Agvekar and Mr. Rajesh Gehani, learned counsels for the employer-Tekchand attacked the impugned award on the following grounds: 2\/19 dss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708 (A) That the Labour Court incorrectly placed the burden of proving 'employer-employee relationship' upon employer-Tekchand ; (B) There is no evidence whatsoever on record to establish that Bharatlal was indeed an employee of Tekchand. The finding to the contrary, is vitiated by 'perversity'; (C) The Labour Court has made reference to documents\/material which were not a part of the record. There is, accordingly, clear non-application of mind which vitiates the impugned award; (D) Without prejudice, there is no material on record that Bharatlal had put in 240 days service in the year preceding the alleged date of termination. The burden of establishing this fact was solely upon Bharatlal, who has miserably failed to discharge the same. In absence of any proof as to such jurisdictional fact, the Labour Court erred in invoking the provisions of Section 25-F of the said Act. 5] Mr. Mandavia, learned counsel for the Bharatlal, at the outset, submitted that Tekchand has been far from candid with the Court and therefore ought to be dis-entitled to invoke the extra ordinary and equitable jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In any case, the counsel submitted that the 3\/19 dss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708 Labour Court has recorded findings of fact which derive support from the material on record. There is neither any perversity nor non- application of mind, in the matter of record of such findings of fact. Accordingly, the counsel urged, that Tekchand had made out no case to warrant judicial review. 6] The counsels did make attempt to argue on the aspect of compliance or otherwise of the interim orders made by this Court in these batch of petitions in the context of motion under Section 17B of the said Act. The counsels for Tekchand complained that despite offer of work, the workmen refused to report for duties. Likewise, counsel for workmen complained that despite the workmen reporting for duties, Tekchand offered them no work. These are seriously disputed questions of fact. Counsel for the workmen, however, submitted that the appropriate proceedings have been taken out before a Forum, where such disputed questions could be effectively gone into. In view of such position, this Court declines to go into the such issue. However, adjudication upon such issue before the appropriate Forum, is expressly kept open. 7] Counsels for Tekchand are right in their contentions that burden of proving existence of 'employer-employee relationship' was upon the workman-Bharatlal, who had asserted the same. The Supreme Court, whilst approving the decisions of Kerala and Calcutta High Court as held: “It is a well settled principle of law that the person who sets up a plea of existence of relationship of employer employee, the burden would be upon him”.1 1 Workmen of Nilgiri Coop. Mkt. Soc. Ltd. vs. State of T.N. & ors. - (2004) 3 SCC 514, N.C. John v. Secy. Thodupuzha Taluk Shop & Commercial Establishment Workers' Union – 1973 Lab IC 398 (Ker) and Swapan Das Gupta v. First Labour Court of W.B. - 1976 Lab IC 202 (Cal) 4\/19 dss j-w2p0-91347:-B08HC-OS:8708 8] In the same decision, however, the Supreme Court went on to observe that the question of existence of 'employer-employee relationship' is a pure question of fact and ordinarily the High Court while exercising its power of judicial review, ought not to interfere, unless the finding is 'manifestly or obviously erroneous or perverse'. To the same effect is the ruling of the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court2. 9] Yet in two other cases3, the Supreme Court whilst reiterating the position regards burden of proof, however, observed that degree of proof so required would vary from case to case and it was neither feasible nor advisable to lay down any abstract rule to determine the existence of such relationship. It was essentially a question of fact to be determined by having regard to the cumulative effect of the entire material placed before the adjudicatory forum by the parties. In the first case, the workman had produced three vouchers evidencing payment of certain sums of money by the . The errors 17\/19 dss j-W2P0-91340:-B08HC-OS:8708 broadly relate to the number of years of services put in by each of the workmen or salary which they drew. Such errors are minor and irrelevant, if the totality of the context is addressed. The errors are certainly not such as would go to the root of jurisdiction or otherwise make any dent in the case of the workmen. The plea for remand based upon such errors, also does not appeal to this Court, particularly at this length of time. The conduct of the petitioner is also not such, as would really entitle the petitioner to secure the assistance of the Court, particularly in the exercise of extra ordinary and equitable jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 31] In the result, this Court sees no reason to interfere with the impugned award. Rule is, accordingly, discharged. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner shall pay costs of Rs.5,000\/- to the respondent-workman. In case any amounts have been deposited by the petitioner under the interim orders made by this Court, the Registry is directed to pay the same to the respondent – workman within a period of four weeks from today. (M. S. SONAK, J.) 32] At this stage, Mr. Agvekar learned counsel for the petitioner, seeks stay on the implementation of the impugned award for a period of eight weeks, as the petitioner desirous to seek recourse against the judgment and order, just pronounced in accordance with law. Mr. Dilip Mandavia, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the workmen have been deprived benefits of the impugned award in their favour from the year 2008 and therefore, restraint of four weeks would suffice. 18\/19 dss j-W2P0-91340:-B08HC-OS:8708 33] Taking into consideration the circumstance that there is interim relief operating in favour of the petitioner right from the year 2008, it is only proper that such interim relief continues for a period of eight weeks from today. Accordingly, the implementation of the impugned award is stayed for a period of eight weeks from today. (M. S.

Sawant, appearing for the respondents, on instructions, states that the contention sought to be raised on behalf of the petitioners are correct in the sense that after issuing the order under Section 8(4) of the Urban Land Ceiling Act, 1976, the petitioners were neither heard nor further steps in accordance with the law were taken and, therefore, there was no final order in terms of the provisions of law for taking over the land in question by the Government. In the circumstances and in view of the repeal of the said Act, the senior counsel appearing for the respondents states that the possession which was taken of the land will have also to be released in favour of the petitioners and that the necessary steps [2] 2008:BHC-OS:10934-DB in that regard would be taken within three weeks and accordingly consequential mutations in relation to the records pertaining to the land will be made in the Government records within the said period of three weeks. 2. We accept the said statement. In view of the said statement, the impugned orders, as mentioned in the prayer clause (a), stand quashed and set aside. While accepting the statement on behalf of the respondents and the directions as above, the petition is disposed of with no order as to costs. (A.A.Sayed, J.)

By consent of the parties, petition is taken up for final hearing. 3. Writ Petition No.767 of 2008 pertains to the A.Y. 2003-04 and Writ Petition No.768 of 2008 pertains - = : 2 : = - 2008:BHC-OS:5813-DB to the A.Y. 2004-05. 3. By this petition, the petitioners are challenging the common order dated 27th March, 2008 whereby the Commissioner of Income Tax-7, Mumbai has directed the petitioners to pay an amount of Rs.13.50 crores by 28th March, 2008 during the pendency of the appeals before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal). 4. Learned senior counsel Shri Dastur pointed out the above demand has been made with regard to the assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05 and brought to our notice a letter dated 21\/2\/2007 whereby the petitioners were directed to deposit a sum of Rs.5 crores on or before 25th March, 2007 with regard to the aforesaid appeals. It appears that the petitioners have already deposited the said sum of Rs.5 crores. Subject to the said condition, the stay was granted upto 31st December, 2007. However, the appeals have not been finally heard and disposed of. On 5th December, 2007 the petitioners received a letter from Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle 7(1), Mumbai directing the petitioners to deposit atleast 50% of the demand, otherwise the stay would be vacated. The petitioners thereafter made a representation on 11th December, 2007 against the said order. By his letter dated 12th February, 2008 the Tax Recovery Officer, - = : 3 : = - 2008:BHC-OS:5813-DB Range 7(1), Mumbai demanded the tax dues. The petitioners thereafter again made a representation on 20th February, 2008 before the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax 7(1). Finally, the impugned order dated 27\/3\/2008 was passed by the Commissioner of Income-tax-7 directing the petitioners to deposit Rs.13.50 crores by 28th March, 2008 with regard to the appeals pertaining to the assessments years 2003-04 and 2004-05 It appears that on 29\/03\/2008 two bank accounts operated by the petitioners have been attached. 5. Having regard to the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the matter, it appears that the petitioners were granted stay subject to the deposit of Rs.5 crores by order dated 21\/2\/2007 upto 31st December, 2007 whereby the above appeals were to be disposed of. However, a fresh demand was made on 5th December, 2007 even when the stay was granted pursuant to the order dated 21\/2\/2007 and continued till 31st December, 2007. Although the appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (A) has been heard on several occasions, the same is not finally disposed off. There is no dispute that the petitioners have co-operated in the matter. Having regard to the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to quash and set aside the order dated 27th March, 2008 and grant stay of recovery subject to the - = : 4 : = - 2008:BHC-OS:5813-DB petitioners depositing an amount of Rs.7 crores on or before 15th April, 2008. The Commissioner of Income Tax (A) shall dispose of the appeals as expeditiously as possible. 6. The respondents shall lift the attachment of the two Bank accounts of the petitioners one with City Bank and other with the Deutsche Bank forthwith. The petitioners undertake to deposit the aforesaid amount of Rs.7 crores in the government treasury positively on or before 15\/4\/2008. The undertaking is accepted. 7. It is made clear that if the aforesaid deposit is not made by 15th April, 2008, the accounts in the above mentioned banks shall stand attached immediately without further notice to this Court. 8. In the event the order is adverse to the petitioners, the same shall not be operated for period of 6 weeks from the date of communication of the said order to the petitioners. 9. Rule is made absolute in the above terms. 10.

She relies on the judgment of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Writ Petition No.2248 of 2013 dated 10.4.2014 to submit that the appropriate remedy will be to approach the Civil Court for redressal of her grievances. Learned counsel for the petitioner fairly agrees to pursue the remedy of approaching the Civil court by filing a suit to assail the action of the Corporation as challenged in the present petition and he seeks leave to withdraw this petition. 3. Writ petition is allowed to be withdrawn with liberty to the petitioner to approach the Civil Court. In order to enable the 2014:BHC-OS:8117 RNG 3 1648.14 petitioner to approach the Civil Court the respondents are directed not to take any further coercive action under impugned orders for a period of eight weeks. It is clarified that this protection is purely to enable the petitioner to approach the Civil Court and is not an observation on the merits of the controversy as arising in the present petition. If an injunction application is moved on behalf of the petitioner the same shall be considered by the Civil Court on its own merits. Writ petition is accordingly disposed of in the aforesaid terms. No order as to costs.

CORAM : V.C.DAGA AND R.M.SAVANT, JJ. DATED : 18th October 2010. JUDGMENT (PER : VIJAY DAGA,J.) Rule, returnable forthwith. Mr.Gupta waives service for the respondents. Both petitions are taken up for hearing by consent of parties. 2. These petitions, filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, are directed against the order dated 3rd March, 2010 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (“Tribunal” for short) dismissing appeal filed by the petitioner together with order dated 25th March, 2010 whereby the miscellaneous application filed by the petitioner was rejected. The petitioner has prayed for 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 2 wp-1805.10.sxw direction to the Tribunal to grant fresh hearing on merits. Since the issues involved in both the petitions are interlinked, they are being disposed of by this common judgment. The Facts : 3. The factual matrix giving rise to the present petitions is as under: The search and seizer action under section 32(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Act” for short) carried out on the residential premises of one of the partners of the petitioner followed by survey action under section 133A of the Act at the business premises resulted in impounding of books of account under section 131 of the Act. The petitioner had filed return of income showing total loss of Rs.3,35,997\/- for the assessment year 1993-94 enclosed with Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet with necessary annexures. 4. The Assessing Officer assessed the income of the petitioner and passed assessment order under section 143(3) of the Act making addition of Rs.55,34,140\/-. He added estimated profit of Rs.16,25,981\/- together with loan transactions and interest, details of which are not necessary for the view taken. 5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of assessment, the petitioner assessee filed appeal before the 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 3 wp-1805.10.sxw Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who was pleased to passed an ex-parte order dated 18th December, 1996 confirming the assessment order. 6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the assessee carried appeal to the Tribunal on 11th February, 1997. 7. It appears that during the pendency of the aforesaid appeal, the petitioner- assessee vide its letter dated 17th March, 2004 claims to have informed the new address to the Assistant Registrar of the Tribunal with further letters dated 7th June, 2007; 20th November, 2008 and 19th December, 2008 enquiring about status of the appeal. According to the petitioner- assessee the certified copy of the Tribunal’s order dated 3rd March, 2003 was handed over to the petitioner on 9th January, 2009. The order reads as under: “The Notice fixing the hearing of the above appeals on 26\/2\/2003, sent by R.P.A.D. at the address indicted by the assessee in column No.10 of Form No.36 has not been returned by the postal authorities. However, at the time of hearing none appeared on behalf of the assessee, nor any request for adjournment was also filed. In these circumstances, following the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Multiplan India (P) Ltd. (38 ITD 320), we dismiss these appeals as unadmitted.” (Emphasis supplied) 8. After receipt of the copy of the order, the petitioner claims to have written a letter to the registry of the Tribunal seeking permission to inspect the documents 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 4 wp-1805.10.sxw so as to enable it to move miscellaneous application for recalling the order dated 3rd March, 2003. Accordingly inspection was given to the petitioner. The petitioner- assessee during the course of the inspection found that R.P.A.D. envelop was returned to the Tribunal with postal endorsement “Not found at given address. Returned to Sender”. After receipt of the aforesaid inspection petitioner moved miscellaneous application to the Tribunal praying for recalling of the order dated 3rd March, 2003 for want of service of notice of hearing resulting in denial of opportunity of hearing. The said application was rejected by the Tribunal by an order dated 25th March, 2010. The said orders are subject matter of challenge in this petitions. Submissions: 9. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the change of address was intimated to the registry of the Tribunal vide letter dated 17th March, 2004 followed by series of letters making enquiry about the status of the appeal. He, thus, submits that it is not a case wherein the Tribunal was not aware of the address of the petitioner-assessee. He, thus, submits that it was obligatory on the part of the Tribunal to send the notice of hearing to the petitioner on the changed address. The photocopies of the letters carrying initials of the person alleged to have received letters in the registry of the Tribunal are produced on record in support of the submission made. Learned counsel for the petitioner, thus, submits that the impugned orders are in breach of 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 5 wp-1805.10.sxw principles of natural justice as such liable to be quashed and set aside and that the matter needs to be remitted back to the Tribunal for consideration afresh. 10. Per contra, learned counsel for the Revenue sought to create some doubt on the letters alleged to have been written and delivered to the registry of the Tribunal. He submits that from the alleged acknowledgments, which does not carry full signature of the person receiving letters, it is not possible to make statement as to whether or not those letters were really received by the Tribunal. He further submits that the record being old, it is not possible to confirm the receipt of those letters. He further submits that it was obligatory on the part of the petitioner- assessee to amend the cause title of the appeal memo so as to indicate the change of address. In his submission, most of the time it happens that the delivered letters do not get tagged to the appeal record. He, thus, submits that the method adopted by the petitioner- assessee of writing letters and intimating the change of address is not a procedure recognised by the Rules governing the appeal procedure. He, thus, submits that the petitions are without any merits and are liable to be dismissed. Consideration : 11. Having heard rival contentions canvassed by the advocates appearing for the parties, without going into the issue relating to the correspondence between the petitioner- assessee and the Tribunal leading to change of 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 6 wp-1805.10.sxw address, these petitions can be decided on the admitted facts available on record. The impugned order dated 3rd March, 2003 specifically mentions that the notice of hearing of appeal informing date of hearing as 26th February, 2003 was sent to the appellant\/petitioner herein by R.P.A.D. at the address indicated by the petitioner- assessee in column 10 of Form No.36 and had not been returned by the postal authorities. The said statement made in the order impugned is factually wrong and incorrect in view of the fact that the notice intimating date of hearing sent by R.P.A.D. was, admittedly, returned back to the Tribunal by the postal authorities with postal endorsement “Not found at given address. Returned to Sender”. It is, thus, clear that the notice sent by R.P.A.D. was not served. It was returned for want of correct address. The Tribunal, thus, could not have treated the service by R.P.A.D. as good service. Under these circumstances, the impugned order is unsustainable and is liable to be quashed and set aside since it is clearly in breach of principles of natural justice. It was also expected on the part of the Tribunal either to issue fresh notice or at least to send an additional copy of the notice to the advocate appearing for the assessee. No such notices appear to have been sent. Consequently, the petitions deserve to succeed, since the orders are in breach of principles of natural justice. 12. Having said so, we may place it on record that in number of cases it has come to our notice that the parties are entering into correspondence with the registry of the 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 7 wp-1805.10.sxw Tribunal to intimate the change of address without amending the address given in column 10 of Form No.36 or in the cause title of the appeal memo. It is also noticed that in most of the cases change of address is not taken on record. Sometime the letter written by the assessee is not attended by the registry of the Tribunal. With the result, the assessee does not get notice of hearing. The matter is heard behind the back of the assessee or his advocate which, ultimately, leads to unsustainable order. It generates litigation either in the same Court by way of rectification application or in the higher Court. In order to avoid this situation, it is desirable to direct the appellant or parties to the appeal to amend cause title of the appeal memo in the event of change of address followed by amendment in column 10 of Form No.36; instead of permitting the parties to enter into the correspondence with the registry of the Tribunal. 13. We, in the above premise, request the President of the Tribunal either to frame rule or issue practice note making it clear to all concerned that in the event of change of address there should be amendment to the cause title of the memo of appeal followed by amendment in column 10 of Form No.36 with further reiteration that any correspondence in this behalf shall not be entertained by the Tribunal. If the procedure suggested is adopted, then the parties before the Tribunal would be compelled to amend their memo of appeal or cross objections as the case may be followed by amendment in Column No.10 of Form No.36 so that it will clearly indicate to the Tribunal the correct 2010:BHC-OS:12422-DB 8 wp-1805.10.sxw address of the appellant so as to enable it to serve the notice of hearing on the assessee at its given address. This will avoid ex-parte hearing and consequent challenge to the order of the Tribunal on the ground of breach of principles of natural justice for want notice. We hope the Tribunal shall take note of anxiety expressed by this Court and inform this Court the compliance of this order. 14. In the result, impugned orders are quashed and set aside. Proceedings are remitted back to the Tribunal for consideration afresh on merits. Petitioner undertakes to appear before the Tribunal on 8th November, 2010. Both petitions are allowed. Rule in both petitions is made absolute in terms of this order with no order as to costs. 15. Prothonotary and Senior Master is directed to send copy of this judgment to the President, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The copy of this judgment should also be forwarded to the President of Central Excise, Customs and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal since the problem noticed by this Court is common to both the Tribunals.

If the petitioner has 2 2006:BHC-OS:12644-DB any grievance he can file a complaint with the S.R.A. It is for the SRA to consider the same. With the above observation petition stands disposed of.

By the above petition, the petitioner who claims to be the resident of the area in question wherein slum rehabilitation scheme has been implemented by the respondent Nos.3 and 4 interalia prays for setting aside, cancellation and for a declaration, as illegal the slum rehabilitation scheme on the property bearing CTS No.501-F\/1, 501-F\/2, 501-E\/1 Part of Village Ghatkopar Kirol, Ghatkopar (W), Mumbai, admeasuring area of 5475.20 sq.mtrs. and for the further relief that the respondent No.1 herein be directed to hand over the recreation ground as 2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB ssp 2 WP 2193 of 2010 per the layout on plot bearing CTS No.501-F\/2 admeasuring area of 1889.90 sq.mtrs. to the federation of the New Maneklal Estate as per the condition of the LOI issued by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority i.e. respondent No.1 herein. 2. In the context of the reliefs sought in the petition, it would be relevant to note a few facts. By a Notification dated 24-01-1983, an area of 4411 sq.mtrs. was made part of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme. Thereafter, by a Notification which was in the nature of Corrigendum, dated 06-02-1997, the said area was increased to 9022.6 sq.mtrs. The respondent No.3 herein, has a Letter of Intent in his favour which has been granted by the SRA for implementation of the said Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, pursuant to which he has undertaken the implementation of the said scheme. 3. We are informed across the Bar that the said Slum Rehabilitation Scheme in so far as the rehabilitation of the Slum dwellers is concerned, has already been completed and the occupation certificate in respect of the building in question has been given partly in the year 2005 and partly in the year 2008. Slum dwellers numbering 265 have accordingly been rehabilitated in the four wings of a cluster building which has been constructed for their rehabilitation under the said scheme. 4. As can be seen, what is sought by the petitioner by way of 2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB ssp 3 WP 2193 of 2010 substantive prayer clause (b) is concerned, is setting aside the scheme to the extent of 5475.20 sq.mtrs., which prayer in our view, at this point of time, cannot be countenanced, in the facts and circumstances of the present case wherein the scheme has been substantially implemented. 5. In so far as the prayer relating to the recreation ground is concerned, though it is true that in terms of the original layout, an area admeasuring 1090. 50 sq.mtrs., was earmarked for recreation ground. It appears that pursuant to the oral directions issued by our Predecessor Bench, the respondent No.3 herein has filed an affidavit dated 23-02-2011, in which at para No.3, it has been stated thus : 3. With reference to paragraph No.1(a) of the Affidavit in Rejoinder, I say that the alleged Association referred by the petitioner i.e. New Maneklal Residential Welfare Association is an association of individual persons and not a Federation of Societies. I further say that the Memorandum of Association attached to the said Affidavit in Rejoinder, clearly indicates that the said alleged association does not have any aims or objects of having a Recreation Garden as alleged by the petitioner. I say that as regards the undertaking is concerned, I say that the said undertaking was given to the Slum Rehabilitation Authorities and I am still abiding by the same. I say that as per the L.O.I. And sanction granted by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, I am ready and willing to hand over the Recreation Ground to the Federation as mentioned in the L.O.I., In view of the same, all allegations and contentions in the paragraph under reply are denied in toto. (Emphasis supplied) 2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB ssp 4 WP 2193 of 2010 5. We therefore, accept the said statement of the respondent No.3 as an undertaking to this Court. It is contended by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that the segregation of the said area of 1095.50 sq.mtrs., of recreation ground into three parts to be provided at three different places in the layout and beyond the slum area is not permissible. According to the learned counsel, recreation ground which is meant for the slum area has to be provided within the area meant for the slum dwellers. It is required to be noted that in respect of the area of 9022.6 sq.mtrs., which is an area on which the said Slum Rehabilitation Scheme is being implemented, a composite layout was submitted by the respondent No.3. The said composite layout interaila contains plot meant for rehabilitation, as also plot wherein the buildings comprising of the flats for free sale are situated. In terms of Regulation 11(4) of the Development Control Regulation 1991, the amenities which are to be provided in a layout can be shifted, provided it is within the same layout. The present case is not a case where the amenity is totally done away with. However, in terms of the undertaking, as recorded herein above, the respondent No.3 has undertaken to provide for the said amenity to the extent of 1095.50 sq.mtrs., may be at three different places and also outside the slum area. However, what is to be borne in mind is that the recreation ground is still situated within the same layout, though may be 2011:BHC-OS:12126-DB ssp 5 WP 2193 of 2010 outside the area meant for the slum dwellers. In the context of the undertaking which has been given by the respondent No.3 as contained in Para No.3 of the said affidavit dated 23-02-2011, in our view, there is no need to issue any directions as prayed for by the petitioner by way of prayer clause (c), as we have already accepted the said statement as an undertaking to this Court. In view of the said undertaking, no further directions need be issued. The above petition accordingly to stand disposed of.

The petitioner had already instituted an appeal under Section 217 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 (“MMC Act”). However, this petition was instituted to challenge Section 217(5) of the MMC Act as ultra vires of Article 14 and 19(1)(f) of the Constitution of India on the ground that this provision required a pre-deposit of the demanded amount. 3. On 14 December 2005, the Division Bench of this Court made the following order:- Page 1 of 3 16th August 2024 914-WP-3117-2005 (F).DOCX 2024:BHC-OS:12592-DB “. Rule. Respondents waive service. 2.

Liberty to the Corporation to apply after the appeal is finally decided. 4. Office to provide authenticated copy” 4. Thus, the petitioner’s grievance was substantially redressed, and the appeal was directed to be disposed of within three months. Ms Tondwalkar is unaware of the appeal’s fate. The petitioner’s representatives or other advocates are also not present. 5. In these circumstances, we proceed on the basis that the appeal has been disposed of. Deciding the issue of vires or constitutional validity without actual lis is unnecessary. The issue of constitutional validity, at least in this petition, is rendered only academic. 6. Besides in Walchandnagar Industries Ltd. Vs The Municipal Corporation City Of Pune & Ors.1, this Court, in the context of similar provisions contained in Section 406 of the MMC Act, has already held that the imposition of pre- condition of deposit of entire disputed tax claimed for the entertainment of appeal was not ultra vires of the Constitution of India. This Court held that the right to an appeal is neither 1 2014 SCC Online BOM 65 Page 2 of 3 16th August 2024 914-WP-3117-2005 (F).DOCX 2024:BHC-OS:12592-DB an absolute right nor an ingredient of the principles of natural justice. Therefore, even otherwise, the challenge to the provisions of Section 217(5) of the MMC Act would, in all probabilities, fail. This could also be why the petitioners are not following up on this petition. 7. This is an old matter that was duly notified on the cause list. 8. For the above reasons, we dismiss this petition without any orders of cost. (Kamal Khata, J) (M.S.

Heard learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners and the learned Senior Counsel appearing for MCGM. 2. By this petition, the Petitioners seek declaration that action of Respondent Nos.2 to 4 in evicting the Petitioners from their premises without giving notice is illegal, malafide, arbitrary, high handed and bad in law. The Petitioners have sought a direction to the Respondents to maintain status quo ante by restoring the premises of the Petitioners. A direction is also sought that no further coercive action be taken in respect of the said premises. The Petitioners have further sought a direction to initiate enquiry against Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 and direct them to pay damages to the Petitioner for their eviction and illegal demolition of the premises in their possession. 1 \/ 4 patilsr W20pl1-264:B34H\/1C6-O. S:12798 3. The Petitioners claim tenancy in a building erected on a plot bearing No. 11, Keshavji Naik Road, Mumbai 400009. In support of their contention, the Petitioners rely upon rent receipts and ration cards, photocopies of which are annexed to the petition. Mr. Jha, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners submitted that the Petitioners are bonafide tenants and the Respondents arbitrarily evicted them and demolished the building standing on the said plot without following the due process of law. 4. Mr. Sakhare, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the MCGM submitted that original structure on the said plot consisting of ground plus two floors, was in dilapidated condition; it collapsed at its own prior to 2010. The owner of the said building thereafter without obtaining any approval from the MCGM, commenced erection of a building on the said plot. Therefore, notices under section 354 of the MMC Act were given on 16th September 2015 and 28th October 2015. Notice was also given under sections 52 and 43 of MRTP Act, being notice dated 9th October 2015. The matter did not end there. An FIR came to be registered against the owner on 29th January 2016. The aforesaid notices were issued to the owner as well as to the occupiers of the said construction. Thereafter said construction was demolished. 2 \/ 4 patilsr W20pl1-264:B34H\/1C6-O. S:12798 Some of the occupants \/ tenants \/ owner challenged the said notices by filing suit in the City Civil Court, Bombay. In the said suit, initially ad- interim relief was granted, however, it was not continued by the City Civil Court. The said tenants\/ occupiers\/ owner then approached this Court by filing an Appeal from Order. However, they could not succeed. Mr. Sakhare submitted that the Corporation demolished the illegal structure thrice and despite this owner \/ tenants\/ occupants continued the construction activity and completed the structure of ground plus 11 floors. The Corporation thereafter started demolition of this building on 8th August 2016 and three floors have already been demolished and all internal walls and slabs of the entire building have been removed. 5. The Petitioners on the basis of the rent receipt claim that they are in possession of the respective premises since October 2015, i.e., since after the issuance of the notice under section 354 of the MMC Act. The owner and earlier tenants made several efforts to protect the illegal structure, but could not succeed. 6. We find that receipts annexed to the petition are for the period January 2016 onwards and the ration-cards on which the Petitioners rely upon are issued in the month of July 2016, i.e., after the issuance of notice under section 354 of the MMC Act. The record 3 \/ 4 patilsr W20pl1-264:B34H\/1C6-O. S:12798 discloses that in earlier round litigation, the owner and some of the tenants made several attempts to protect the structure by filing various proceedings in the Courts, however those efforts were rendered futile by the MCGM by pointing out the reals fact situation of the case to the Court. 7. We find that the Petitioners have approached this Court by suppressing earlier proceedings taken out in the City Civil Court and the orders passed therein. In the light of these facts and circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that this is another attempt by the owner \/ landlord to protect the illegal structure. We are also satisfied that the Petitioners have not come to the Court with clean hands. This is nothing but the abuse of the process of law. In these circumstances, we dismiss the writ petition with exemplary costs which are quantified at Rs.10,000\/- payable by each of the Petitioners. The Petitioners shall deposit the said costs in this Court within eight weeks from today. If the cost is not deposited within the stipulated period, the same shall be recovered from the Petitioners as arrears of land revenue. [SMT.

DATED : 4th MARCH, 2009. P.C. : 1. It is agreed between the counsel that the order in Writ Petition No.2768 of 2008 would govern the result in all the Writ Petitions. They are accordingly disposed of by this common order. 2. The impugned order, passed by the 3rd Labour Court in a Reference, directs the Petitioner to reinstate Respondent No.1 with full backwages and continuity of service. The issues before the Labour Court were whether the first Respondent proved that : 3 : 2009:BHC-OS:3442 the Petitioner had illegally terminated him from service with effect from 30.4.1999 ; whether the first Respondent proved that he had continuously worked for more than 240 days in a year just prior to the termination and whether the first Respondent is entitled to get the relief of reinstatement with full back wages and continuity of service with effect from 2.8.1999. The issues have been answered in the affirmative in the first Respondent’s favour. 3. The Petitioner’s case is that on 24.8.1999, it had closed down its business. However, to avoid commercial litigation from the prospective buyers,it had no alternative but to start manufacturing activities on a temporary basis to complete the work in hand. It is further contended that on completion of such work, it completely closed down the manufacturing activities with effect from 10.7.2000. Thereafter and to date, it has not restarted the manufacturing activities. Further according to the Petitioner, Respondent No.1 had voluntarily left its services in August, 1999 realizing that the Petitioner did not have much work. 4. The Labour Court has found that the first Respondent had established that he worked for 240 days with the Petitioner. This finding is based on the : 4 : 2009:BHC-OS:3442 evidence including the oral evidence. The findings are purely on facts. I am not inclined to interfere with the same. Nor am I inclined to interfere with the finding that the termination was wrongful. Admittedly, there was no show cause notice or any other action taken to discontinue the Petitioner’s employment. In fact the question does not arise as the Petitioner’s case is that the first Respondent voluntarily left the employment. The impugned order records that the Petitioner did not lead any evidence to show that the first Respondent tendered his resignation after accepting the legal dues on 3.8.1999. This again is a finding of fact based on an appreciation of the evidence and I am not inclined to interfere with the same. 5. Mr.Talsania however, submitted that in any event,there was no justification for ordering reinstatement as the manufacturing activities of the Petitioner had completely closed down atleast with effect from 10.7.2000. Thereafter there were only two employees. The finding in this regard is essentially again one of fact. 6. It is true that the issue of closure has been dealt with only very briefly in paragraph 32 of the impugned order which reads as under :- : 5 : 2009:BHC-OS:3442 \"32. Though it is tried to submit by first party that the manufacturing activities of first party were finally closed with effect from 25.8.1999 but this closure is not established by leading sufficient evidence. Moreover the deposition of the witness of the first party does not inspire any confidence to place reliance on its considering the admissions given by him in the corss-examination. Thus the first party failed to show that the manufacturing activities are finally closed.\" 7. Ms.Joshi, submitted that no fault can be found with the impugned order in this regard as no issue regarding closure had been raised and the Petitioner had not raised any grievance about the fact that no issue had been raised. 8. I will presume however in favour of the Petitioner that no issue having been raised does not disentitle the Petitioner from raising the contention. Admittedly, the pleadings do contain averments regarding the closure. The oral evidence also deals with this aspect. The parties were therefore aware that the issue of closure had been raised and was to be dealt with. 9. While I see the force in Mr.Talsania’s submission that this aspect has not been dealt with in detail, considering the facts of the present case I am : 6 : 2009:BHC-OS:3442 not inclined to interfere with the order. 10. The learned Member found the evidence of the Petitioners not to inspire any confidence. The conclusion is not absurd or perverse. In his cross-examination, the witness stated that he did not know whether the Petitioner used to export garments as per the quota allotted by A.E.P.C. He stated that he did not know the turn-over of the company inter-alia in the year 1999-2000. He further submitted that one Dinesh Vora was looking after the accounts section. The said Dinesh Vora was not examined. He would have been in a position to state whether or not there were any manufacturing activities after July, 2000. The accounts would have been relevant in this regard. They were not produced. The relevant witness was therefore not examined. 11. The Petitioner’s witness admitted in his cross-examination which was conducted in the year 2008 that the factory licence and the B.M.C. licence obtained in the year 1976 had been renewed every year to date. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, there would be a justifiable inference of the manufacturing activities having continued in view of the factory licence having been renewed to date. It was not the Petitioner’s case that the factory : 7 : 2009:BHC-OS:3442 licence had been renewed only as a matter of course or through inadvertence. There was no re-examination. 12. The Petitioner’s witness also admitted that there is a show-room inside the factory and the garments were displayed therein. He further stated that he did not know the reason for displaying the garments in the show-room. He stated that he did not know whether garments were displayed in the show-room to attract the customers. This was a relevant consideration. The witness stated that he does not even know how many orders he had received from the customers. . The witness not having offered an explanation, it was not open to the Petitioner to offer an explanation through his counsel across the bar. It was contended that the garments displayed were only in respect of the export business. 13. Further the Petitioner’s witness stated that he was unaware of the business activities of the Petitioner. 14. What is surprising is that he stated that he is unaware of the contents of paragraph 4 of his own affidavit. Paragraph 4 of the affidavit contains : 8 : 2009:BHC-OS:3442 various statements regarding the workload from time to time, the financial difficulties faced due to the recession in textile industries and about the alleged closure. Thus he has failed to prove closure even in his examination in chief. Moreover the witness has thus not been able to answer any questions in cross-examination relevant to the closure. 15. I am in respectful agreement that this evidence cannot inspire any confidence. 16. There was no re-examination. The best evidence was obviously held back. The admissions especially regarding the factory licence have not been explained. 17. In the circumstances, all the above Writ Petitions are dismissed. The impugned order shall remain stayed upto 30.4.2009.","label":[[136,167,"PETITIONER"],[184,206,"RESPONDENT"],[258,289,"PETITIONER"],[306,332,"RESPONDENT"],[1479,1495,"CORAM"],[1505,1520,"ORDER_DATE"]],"Comments":[]}

A praecipe is filed by the Advocate appearing for respondent Nos.3 to 9 and 11 to 13 for speaking to the Minutes of our order passed on 6th May 2005. The praecipe seeks some corrections in the order passed. (a). Firstly, it is stated that in the appearances, the words \"respondent Nos.11 to 13\" remained to be typed. It is wrongly typed as under:- \"Mr.Milind Vasudeo with M.G.Gawade for respondents 3 to 9.\" It will, therefore, be corrected and read as -2- follows:- 2005:BHC-OS:7138-DB \"Mr.Milind Vasudeo with Mr.M.G.Gawde for respondent Nos.3 to 9 and 11 to 13.\" (b). In paragraph 10 on page 8 of the order, there is a sentence which reads as under:- \" The Charity Commissioner granted permission vide order dated 20th January 2004. The sanction accorded by the Charity Commissioner to raise loan was on a condition that all trustees shall execute personal guarantees in favour of Union Bank of India. \" This sentence will stand deleted by the following sentence:- \" This order dated 20th January 2004 according sanction by the Charity Commissioner, which is modified by the order dated 10th March 2004, permits respondent No.8 to execute the Personal Guarantee.\" (c). In paragraph 11 of the order, there is a -3- sentence which reads as follows:- 2005:BHC-OS:7138-DB \" Although, the proposal was for some reasonable period, the resolution provides for lease of 20 years. \" Instead of that sentence, the following sentence will stand substituted:- \" The proposal suggested a lease of 20 years.\" (d). The last but one sentence in paragraph 24 of the order will stand deleted, which reads as follows:- \" Even this suggestion has been accepted.\" (e). The last sentence in paragraph 26 reads as follows:- \" This we are doing despite consent of parties.\" Mr.Vasudeo, learned Counsel appearing for respondent Nos.3 to 9 and 11 to 13, submitted that this sentence be deleted. It is not possible to -4- accept this suggestion. The sentence is necessary 2005:BHC-OS:7138-DB to connote what happened exactly in the Court and the fact that the order was being passed in spite of consent of the parties for part of the modalities. 2. The last request of Mr.Vasudeo is to extend the period for implementation which was six weeks under paragraph 27(G) of the order. Mr.Sakhare, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners, has thereupon asked a question as to whether the respondents are going to implement the order. Mr.Vasudeo has inclined to make any positive statement. This being the position, it is not possible for us to extend the time. 3. In view of the above, the praecipe filed for speaking to the Minutes stands disposed of.

Counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 has filed an application for recovery of arrears of rent before the Estate Officer. The present Petitioner - non applicant took a preliminary objection with regard to the maintainability of the application and with a prayer that the matter be sent to a High Powered Committee as it related to a dispute between two public sector undertakings. 2009:BHC-OS:1223-DB 2 3. According to Counsel appearing for the Petitioner the order of the Estate Officer is contrary to the principles of law stated in different judgments and such matters may be referred to a High Powered Committee constituted under the judgment of the Supreme Court. On the other hand, the contention raised for the Respondents is that this is not a matter which deserves to be referred to a High Powered Committee and is purely a matter of recovery of arrears of rent simplicitor. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. v. Life Insurance Corporation of India – AIR 1997 SC 2590 as well as of this Court in the case of National Aviation Company of India Limited v. Life Insurance Corporation of India decided on 7th October, 2008 has clearly rejected such contentions.

KANADE & M.S.KARNIK, JJ. DATE : 22nd APRIL, 2016 P.C. : 1. Heard. 5\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc 2. The petitioners are the civil works contractors and have completed several contracts entrusted to them by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. According to the petitioners, they have submitted their bids for tenders in 'K'\/East ward. However, they were informed that the Corporation has given a direction to lock the user ids of number of contractors. It is the case of the petitioners that when they made an enquiry with the concerned ward office of the Corporation, they were informed that user ids were blocked in view of the directions given by the Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Z-1). They were also informed that petitioners were black listed by the Corporation. Aggrieved by the said action, the petitioners have filed these Petitions. The petitioners are seeking an appropriate writ, order and direction for setting aside black listing of the petitioners under the circulars dated 08\/10\/2014, 20\/11\/2014 and 09\/12\/2014. 6\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc 3. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the said order is expressly bad and illegal since neither show cause notice was given or enquiry was made nor they were given a personal hearing by the Corporation. He submitted that the order of black listing is violative of principles of natural justice and therefore, the same is liable to be quashed and set aside. He submitted that 3 Petitions were filed by 3 contractors who were black listed and their Writ Petitions were allowed by the Division Bench of this Court by order dated 04\/03\/2015. He invited our attention to the order passed by the Division Bench of this Court dated 04\/03\/2015 in Writ Petition (L) No.465 of 2015. He submitted that, in fact, these circulars were withdrawn by the Corporation by issuing a fresh circular dated 27\/03\/2015. He submitted that in spite of withdrawal of the said circulars, the Corporation was still blocking their user ids. He submitted that the Corporation may be given a direction not to block 7\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc their user ids and permit them to offer their bids. In support of his submissions, he placed reliance on the following decisions of the Apex Court. i) M\/s.Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. Vs. State of West Bengal and another, (1975) 1 Supreme Court Cases 70. ii) Gorkha Security Services Vs. Government (NCT of Delhi) and others, (2014) 9 Supreme Court Cases, 105. 4. Mr.Sakhare, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that the order dated 04\/03\/2015 was passed only qua petitioner in the said Petitions. He invited our attention to the order dated 27\/10\/2015 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in Writ Petition (L) No. 2882 of 2015 in which in paragraph 2 of the order, the Division Bench of this Court has observed that order of setting aside the black listing was passed qua petitioner in the Writ Petition. 8\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc 5. He submitted that the Corporation was ready to give hearing to the petitioners and the process of giving hearing would be completed within a period of 8 weeks. 6. He submitted that post decisional hearing can be given in certain cases. He submitted that the Division Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No. 569 of 2013 in case of Paras V. Mehta Vs. Mumbai Municipal Corporation and others decided on 23\/08\/2013 had, almost in similar circumstances, permitted post decisional hearing to be given to the petitioner in the said case. He submitted that in the said case also, by way of interim measure, certain contractors were black listed and show cause notice was issued to the petitioner in the said case and enquiry was held thereafter. He submitted that the Division Bench of this Court had observed that it was open for the Corporation by way of interim measure to suspend the registration of a contractor in public interest and 9\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc thereafter, hold an enquiry. 7. He invited our attention to the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent. He submitted that so far as circular dated 27\/03\/2015 is concerned, the said circular was issued by the City Engineer, Secretary, Registration Committee and the Director, ES & P, Chairman Registration Committee and not by the Municipal Commissioner and an enquiry therefore, was being held against those officials who were responsible for issuing the said circular of withdrawing the black listing of contractors. 8. He submitted that it was noticed by the Municipal Commissioner that number of contractors were, without completing any work, receiving money which they were not entitled to and there was a large scale fraud committed by these contractors in connivance with municipal employees. He submitted that in these 10\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc circumstances, the Municipal Commissioner was constrained to issue these circulars of black listing. He submitted that the petitioners had approached this Court almost after 10 months. He submitted that the Petitions were filed on 19\/10\/2015 and the last circular of black listing of contractors was issued on 09\/12\/2014. He submitted that almost after 10 months these Petitions were filed and no explanation was given in the Petitions for the delay caused in filing the Petitions. He submitted that therefore, no prejudice would be caused if the petitioners are given hearing now. He, therefore, submitted that in view of the gross delay caused in filing these Petitions and on account of the fraudulent activities of the petitioners, interim relief may not be granted in favour of the petitioners. 9. On the other hand, Mr.Marathe, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted 11\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc that judgment in the case of Paras V. Mehta (supra) can be distinguished on facts. He submitted that in the said case, show cause notice was issued and thereafter, the circular was issued, whereas in the present case, admittedly, show cause notice was not issued before the impugned circulars were issued by the Corporation. He submitted that there was no delay in filing these Petitions because the petitioners came to know about their black listing only after Writ Petitions which were filed by 3 contractors was allowed and thereafter they came to know that user ids were blocked by the Corporation. He submitted that it is a settled position in law that order of black listing cannot be passed without giving a hearing and without issuing a show cause notice. 10. After having heard both the Counsels at length, we are of the view that the submission made by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners cannot be accepted. Though it is well settled that, normally, whenever 12\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc an order of black listing is passed, such an order can only be passed after following the principles of natural justice. 11. In the present case, however, the impugned circulars were issued on 08\/10\/2014, 20\/11\/2014, 09\/12\/2014 and the present Petitions have been filed on 19\/10\/2015, i.e almost one year after the first circular dated 08\/10\/2014 was issued. In the Petitions, no explanation has been given for the delay and latches caused in filing the Petitions or for claiming interim relief. The explanation which is given that the petitioners came to know in the last week of December 2014 cannot be accepted. It is submitted by the petitioners that when the petitioners enquired with the concerned ward officer of the Corporation, they came to know that few of the black listed contractors received E-mail from the Corporation and this was the communication by which the petitioners came to know about the impugned circulars. It 13\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc is not possible to accept the said submission made by the petitioners. In paragraph 9 of the Petitions, petitioners stated that they came to know for the first time in the last week of December 2014 about the impugned circulars. In subsequent paragraph, the petitioners have stated that thereafter they were informed about the impugned circulars passed by the Corporation. The fact remains that initial knowledge about the impugned circulars became available to the petitioners in the last week of December 2014. Therefore, there is delay of 10 months in approaching this Court. 12. From the affidavit-in-reply filed by the Corporation, it is evident that number of contractors are involved in fraudulent practices to cause monetary loss to the Corporation and as a result, the Municipal Commissioner has no other option but to issue the impugned circulars. It is true that normally, before issuing 14\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc an order of black listing, show cause notice is given to the petitioner and after giving him a hearing, the impugned circular is issued. In the present case, however, since the petitioners have themselves approached this Court almost after one year, this grievance cannot be available to the petitioners. 13. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Paras V. Mehta (supra) has observed that by way of interim measure, order of suspension can be passed. We are of the view that the impugned circulars, therefore, will have to be treated as an interim measure for suspending the registration. The Division Bench of this Court in Paras V. Mehta (supra) has observed in paragraphs 15 & 16 as under: “15] There is a well settled distinction between interim measures,which are made as a holding operation pending full fledged enquiry and final action either by way of 15\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc inflicting penalty or orders of blacklisting and deregistration. The impugned letter dated 14.2.2013 and circular dated 16.3.2013 indicate that the respondents, pending final decision on the aspect of blacklisting or deregistration, felt it appropriate that no work orders be issued to the petitioner or that any further tender bids that may be submitted by the petitioner be not considered in the interregnum. At this stage, there can be no insistence upon rigid compliance with principles of natural justice. If serious irregularities are suspected, then pending appropriate enquiry, it may not be unreasonable to take interim measures by way of holding operation. In the case of Lewis v. Heffer, 1978 (3) ALL E.R.354, Lord Denning drew out the distinction between suspensions which are inflicted by way of punishment and suspensions, which are made as holding operation pending enquiry in the following words: “ But they do not apply to suspensions which are made, as a holding operation, pending enquiries. Very often irregularities are disclosed in a Government department or in a business house; and a man may be suspended on full pay pending enquiries. Suspicion may rest on him; and so he is suspended until he is cleared of it. No one, so far as I know, has ever questioned such a suspension on the ground that it could not be done unless he is giving notice of the charge and an opportunity of defending 16\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc himself and so forth. The suspension in such a case is merely done by way of good administration. A situation has arisen in which something must be done at once. The work of the department or the office is being affected by rumours and suspicions. The others will not trust the man. In order to get back to proper work, the man is suspended. At that stage the rules of natural justice do not apply, see Furnell v. Whangarei High Schools Board”. 16] The aforesaid observations were cited with approval by the Supreme Court in the case of Liberty Oil Mills V\/s. Union of India, 1984(3) SCC 465, by observing that predecisional natural justice is not usually contemplated when the decision taken are of an interim nature pending investigation or inquiry. 14. In the present case, show cause notice was not issued by the Corporation before issuing the impugned circulars and since the petitioners have themselves approached this Court after one year, no prejudice will be caused to them, if the Corporation gives them hearing within 12 weeks from today. 17\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc 15. So far as the order of this Court in Writ Petition (L) No. 465 of 2015 is concerned, the Division Bench of this Court by order dated 27\/10\/2015 passed in Writ Petition (L) No. 2882 of 2015 has observed that the said order of setting aside black listing would be applicable only qua petitioner in the said Petition. In paragraph 2 of the said order, the Division Bench has observed as under : “The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the orders of black listing as against the petitioners have been set aside by the order dated 4th March 2015 in the Writ Petition (L) No. 465 of 2015. We disagree with the said submission. We find that the order of black listing only in so far as the writ petitioner in the said writ petition has been set aside.” 16. We, therefore, keeping larger public interest in mind, do not propose to interfere with the impugned circulars which have been issued by the Corporation from October 2014 to December 2014. We, however, direct the Corporation to issue show cause notices to the petitioners 18\/19 2016:BHC-OS:5891-DB 906. wp 134.16 & others.doc and to give personal hearing to the petitioners. We direct the Corporation to issue show cause notices within 4 weeks from today. The petitioners may give replies to the said show cause notices within 4 weeks thereafter and the Corporation after hearing the petitioners shall decide the said show cause notices within 4 weeks thereafter. The entire process, therefore, to be completed within 12 weeks from today. It is clarified that the if Corporation accepts the explanation given by any of the petitioners, it may revoke the black list and if the order of black listing is confirmed, the petitioners are at liberty to challenge the said order. With the aforesaid directions, these Petitions are disposed of. (M.S.KARNIK, J.) (V. M.
